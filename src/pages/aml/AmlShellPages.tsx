/**
 * Re-exports for the AML surfaces the shell routes to.
 *
 * This file used to also DEFINE one: `AmlIntakeQueue`, which rendered the
 * shared placeholder shell with no children — an alert reading "Data wires in
 * a later phase" and a card headed "Placeholder workspace". It made no data
 * call and offered no action, and it had shipped to production. It is deleted
 * rather than unmounted, along with `AmlShellPage` itself, because a
 * placeholder that still exists is one route away from being back in the
 * navigation.
