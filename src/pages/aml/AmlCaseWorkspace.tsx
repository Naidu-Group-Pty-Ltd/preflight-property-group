/**
 * Full-page AML case workspace — the ten-stage compliance journey.
 *
 * ── What an operator sees ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   identity + risk + gate            persistent header
 *   ten numbered journey stages       the primary navigation
 *   one stage workspace at a time     the existing section components
 *   live position · readiness ·       sticky right rail
 *     attention · next action
 *   Previous · Stage X of 10 · Next   footer
 *
 * ── What the journey changed, and what it did not ─────────────────────
 * The twelve sections are unchanged. Each still lives at the same
 * `?section=` key, still mounts the same component, and still calls the
 * same server operations under the same server-side authorisation. What
 * changed is that the operator no longer has to know the architecture to
 * find them: the rail is the AML process, and each stage says whose move
 * it is, what is blocking it, and where the work is done.
 *
 * Two sections moved stage rather than section. Screening left the
 * identity stage — identity evidence and a sanctions finding answer
 * different questions and the directive is explicit that their meanings
 * must not be merged — and both are still reachable at `?section=identity`
 * and `?section=ownership` exactly as before.
 *
 * ── Nothing on this page is an authority ──────────────────────────────
 * Everything the rail and the right rail show is derived, per render, by
 * the pure helpers in `src/lib/aml/journeyModel.ts` and
 * `src/lib/aml/workspaceViewModel.ts`. None of it is stored. Selecting a
 * stage, or pressing Next, is a page turn: it moves no case stage, no
 * verification outcome, no screening result, no decision, no service gate,
 * no Passport version and no partner access. The service gate is still
 * moved only by an explicit human decision recorded server-side, the
 * Passport is still issued only by `aml-reliance issue_attestation`, and
 * partner distribution readiness is still derived by the server.
 *
 * Rendered at /admin/aml/cases/:caseId behind `aml_v3_case_workspace`;
 * while the flag is off the route redirects to the legacy side-sheet deep
 * link so nothing breaks mid-rollout.
