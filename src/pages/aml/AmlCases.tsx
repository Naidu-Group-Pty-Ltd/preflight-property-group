        The staged-rollout gate, said out loud — to the one audience that can

        `aml_v3_case_workspace` decides whether a case opens in the full
        journey workspace or the legacy dialog, and it defaults to off. That
        is correct for a staged rollout and wrong to keep silent: with the
        flag off, `/admin/aml/cases/:caseId` redirects here and a row opens
        the dialog, so a finished workspace and an absent one look exactly
        the same — which is how it stayed switched off from Phase 6 to now,
        with the only toggle for it on a page linked from nowhere.

        Shown to superadmins alone, because rollout plumbing is not an
        operator's concern and the cutover page refuses anyone else.

        It says which of TWO things happened, and that distinction is the
        whole reason this notice was not enough on its own. "Switched off"
        and "could not be read" produce identical flag values — all false —
        and for months the second wore the first's clothes: the flag was on
        in the database and the browser could not see the table, so this
        very notice would have reported a switched-off feature and sent a
        superadmin to a toggle that was already on.
