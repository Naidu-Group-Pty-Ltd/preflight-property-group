/**
 * The presentation layer's one entry point: a validated report plus the
 * template chosen for its format, drawn in the browser.
 *
 * Resolves a production-capable adapter for the report, resolves the chosen or
 * best-matching active template, renders it through the Report Presentation
 * Renderer, and returns null so callers fall back to the standard presentation
 * whenever this is not ready.
 *
 * ## The template never becomes a second source of truth
 *
 * `adapter.buildBindingContext` produces ONE frozen payload describing the
 * report after generation, calculation, reconciliation, validation and the
 * user's own edits. Everything below binds against that payload and nothing
 * else: no calculation runs here, no geography is resolved, no model is
 * called and nothing is fetched from a source table. One validated report,
 * several approved presentations.
 *
 * ## Two renderers, chosen by the caller
 *
 * The same validated payload and the same template can be drawn two ways:
 *
 *  * `browser` — the Report Presentation Renderer (jsPDF), in this tab.
 *    Instant, free, and limited: it embeds no fonts (every face becomes
 *    Helvetica), draws no block the registry marks partial, and cannot draw
 *    text on a filled panel legibly. It is the PREVIEW.
 *  * `weasyprint` — the same template compiled to print HTML and rendered by
 *    the pinned engine through `render-template-pdf`. Every declared typeface
 *    embedded, every block the HTML renderer knows, the document stored where
 *    a portal can serve it. It is the FINAL client document, and it is asked
 *    for only by a deliberate final action (RV-1, 14 Sep 2026).
 *
 * Nothing above the renderer changes with the choice: one adapter, one frozen
 * payload, one template, the same guards. Only the last step differs.

 * Run's own 500 page for more than five hours (`RENDER_SERVICE_AVAILABILITY.md`).
 * Every chosen template fell back to the standard pdf-lib layout, and the one

 * design it would be sent in — could not get it from the product at all,
 * while the in-tab renderer that had drawn that exact template for a year

 *
 * ## What may stand in, and what may not
 *
 * Only a failure OF THE ENGINE: it did not answer (`engine_unavailable`), or
 * it answered with a 5xx of its own (`engine_failed`) — in both the document
 * was never drawn. A refusal (`engine_refused`: credentials, a document it
 * will not take) is not stood in for, because the browser would ship the
 * same document the engine declined. And nothing but a `RenderServiceError`
 * qualifies: the client-readiness gate answers 409 as a plain error, and a
 * document the server refused as not client-ready must not come out of a
 * different renderer. (The gate runs BEFORE the engine is called, so an
 * engine failure means the gate had already passed for this document.)
 *
 * And only where every block is one the browser renderer draws in full —
 * the same judgement `renderer: 'browser'` is subject to. A placeholder
 * panel on a client's page is worse than the standard document.
 *
 * The result is still marked (`degradedFrom`, and `renderer` names the
 * browser): a stand-in is a templated document, not the final one, and the
