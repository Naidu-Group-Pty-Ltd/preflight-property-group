/**
 * A refusal names the gate that closed.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `routeReportThroughTemplate` answers `null` for eight distinct reasons, and
 * every one of them is a fallback to the format's own composer — which, on the
 * migrated formats, is itself a well-typeset WeasyPrint document. So "your
 * template rendered" and "your template was skipped" looked identical from the
 * outside, and identical in the console: the only surviving evidence of which
 * gate had closed was a query against `template_render_jobs` in production,
 * and the answer to "why didn't my template apply?" cost a round trip every
 * time.
 *
 * Naming the refusal turns that into one click. The route still returns `null`
 * — every failure is a fallback and never an error, which is the rule that
 * keeps a templated document from being the reason somebody cannot get their
 * file — but the caller can now say which gate, and `tryTemplateDocument` puts
 * it in the toast the person is already reading.
