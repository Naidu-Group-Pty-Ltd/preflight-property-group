 * snake_case, `financial_calculations` nested under `initialCosts` / `income` /
 * `keyMetrics` / `loanDetails` / `annualCosts` / `assumptions`, and
 * `investment_score.risks` as an array of plain strings. Only the values are
 * synthetic. A fixture written in the catalogue's own vocabulary would pass
