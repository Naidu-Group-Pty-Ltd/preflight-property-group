/**
 * The seed migration's drift guard is EMITTED, not hand-added.
 *
 * The seed migration — whichever release `RELEASE_ID` currently names — opens
 * with an `@effect:` probe — a lone SELECT stating what is true once the migration has run.
 * `scripts/ops/migration-drift.mjs` needs it because this migration **creates
 * no object**, so there is nothing for drift detection to count and it would
 * be reported as unverifiable. Its own comment records the cost of that:
 * *"which is exactly how seed v18 merged to main, never landed, and left every
 * report printing the heading it was written to fix."*
 *
 * **The generator did not emit it.** So the first thing the documented
 * workflow does — `CLAUDE.md`: *"never hand-edit the generated migration —
 * edit the source and run `npm run templates:library:seed`"* — was silently
 * delete the guard that exists because a seed once merged without landing.
 * Measured: a seed run on an unchanged tree produced an 8-line deletion and
 * nothing else, and produces none now.
 *
 * These assertions are over the committed FILE and the generator SOURCE
 * together, because either one alone can be right while the pair disagrees —
 * which is the state this closes. Regenerating is the real guarantee and is
 * too slow for a unit test (543 templates, 40 MB); these two catch the
 * deletion by any route.
