 * projection then restates that document; neither re-reads
 * `report_qa_messages`.
 *
 * ## The variant picks the subject
 *
 * This format is three documents, not one: the whole `transcript`, a single
 * `answer`, and the conversation's `structured` report. The Cash Flow adapter
 * already establishes that `variant` is what the caller asked for rather than
 * what the row says, and this reads it the same way. `transcript` is the
 * default because it is the only subject that is well-defined without also
 * being told *which* answer.
 *
 * The `structured` subject is accepted but not published by the projection —
 * see `reportQaProjection.pure.ts` for why binding a separately-generated
 * report beside the turns would put two answers to one question on a page.
