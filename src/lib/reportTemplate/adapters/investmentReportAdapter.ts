 * result, which fell straight into the documented "degrade to the report's own
 * headings" path. So the degradation was not a fallback at all, it was the only
 * behaviour, and `sections.<contract id>` resolved to the empty string on every
 * Investment render. Measured in production 2026-08-16; see `secureSource.ts`

 * for every row ever read, and the expression fell through to `report_scope` —
 * which is `address` or `suburb`, a *geography*, not a format.
 *

 * | `compass` | 1,124 | `investment_compass` | yes |

 * | `briefing` | 21 | **`address`** | no |
 * | `strategic` | 9 | **`address`** | no |
 * | `financial` | 9 | **`address`** | no |
 *
 * `address` matches no adapter, no entry in `REPORT_TYPE_ALIASES` and no row in
 * `report_templates`, so `routeReportThroughTemplate` refused with
 * `no_active_template` and fell back to the legacy generator every time. The
 * render ledger agrees: of every job it holds, five are `investment_compass`
 * and **none** is any other tier.
 *
 * All five tiers are one format. `REPORT_TYPE_ALIASES` already folds
 * `investment_compass` onto `investment`, so naming the compass tier separately
 * costs nothing and keeps the routing context readable — but the scope must
 * never be mistaken for a format again.
