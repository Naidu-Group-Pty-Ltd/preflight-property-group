/**
 * The general entry point — any production format, one call.
 *
 * The Compass function above was the pilot, and for a year it was also the
 * only door: every other format's fifty masters were seeded, adapter and all,
 * with no way for a product surface to route a report through them. This is
 * that door, and it is deliberately **inert until somebody activates a
 * template**: `resolveReportTemplate` matches only *active* `report_templates`
 * rows, so calling this for a deployment with nothing activated returns null
 * and costs one lookup. Activation is the switch — exactly what every
 * adapter's `legacyFallback` text promises ("…remains the default until a
 * template is activated for this report type").
 *
 * What this does **not** do is intercept the formats' flowing render routes.
 * `requestBorrowingCapacitySnapshot`, `requestCapacityReport`,
 * `requestReportQaPdf` and `requestMarketIntelligencePdf` carry documented
 * contracts of their own — ledgers, audit events, the `pdf_storage_path` a
 * scheduled email reads, "no legacy fallback, on purpose" — and a template
 * render silently replacing them would skip those side effects the day a
 * template went active. A surface that wants templated output calls this
 * first and falls back to its own path on null, the way `PremiumPdfButton`
 * already does for Compass.
 *
 * Returns null — never throws — for a preview-only or unknown report type, a
 * report the adapter refuses, or a deployment with no active template, so a
 * caller's fallback chain stays one `??` long.
