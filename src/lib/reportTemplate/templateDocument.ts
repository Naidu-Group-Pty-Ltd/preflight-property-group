/**
 * "Is there an activated template for this document?" — asked once, the same
 * way, by every format's delivery path.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * Nine adapters can turn a stored record into a templated PDF, and for a year
 * exactly one surface could ask for one: `PremiumPdfButton`, for Compass
 * investment reports. Every other format's fifty masters could be designed,
 * previewed, seeded and activated, and no button in the product would ever
 * render one. This is the call that closes that gap, and it belongs in the
 * `deliver*` modules rather than in the buttons because that is where every
 * surface for a format already meets — the download, the email attachment, the
 * blob a broker portal uploads.
 *
 * ## It is inert until somebody activates a template
 *
 * `resolveReportTemplate` matches only *active* `report_templates` rows, so on
 * a deployment with nothing activated this costs one lookup and answers null,
 * and the format's existing route runs exactly as it does today. That is the
 * designed switch, and it is what every adapter's `legacyFallback` text
 * promises: "the legacy generator remains the default until a template is
 * activated for this report type".
 *
 * ## Every failure is a fallback, never an error
 *
 * A refused adapter, no active template, a render that failed, a signed URL
 * that would not fetch: all of them answer `null`, because the caller's next
 * line is the route that has produced this document for the life of the
 * product. A templated document is an improvement on a working path, so it may
 * never be the reason somebody cannot get their file.

 * ## Why this is looked up here rather than passed in
 *
 * The picker lists **every** format the adapter registry knows, and its own
 * words are "a choice is kept for every report of that format until it is
 * changed here". Only `PremiumPdfButton` ever passed the chosen id, so on the
 * other eight formats a selection was stored, displayed as selected, and then
 * ignored by the thing it was a choice about — the UI promising something the
 * generator did not do, which is worse than not offering the choice.
 *
 * Threading the id through eight `deliver*` signatures would have fixed the
 * surfaces that remembered to pass it and left the same hole open for the
 * email, attachment and portal paths that do not use the picker's hook. Asking
 * here means the choice is honoured wherever a document is produced, which is
 * what the picker says happens.
 *
 * Not cached: a person who changes their template and generates again expects
 * the new one, and one edge call against a download that already takes seconds
 * is the cheaper side of that trade. A failed read answers null and the format
 * resolves by ranking, exactly as it did before selections existed.
