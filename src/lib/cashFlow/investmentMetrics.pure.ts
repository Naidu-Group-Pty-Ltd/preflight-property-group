/**
 * The investment metrics a property comparison is ranked on.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module
 *
 * It was a `useCallback` inside `CashFlowAnalysisModal`, fed by two different
 * readings of a report: `baseFinancialData` (via `readBaseFinancials`) for the
 * property the adviser had open, and a hand-rolled `compBaseData` for every
 * property it was compared against. `readBaseFinancials` exists *because* that
 * divergence was found once already — and the comparison call site was never
 * switched over to it.
 *
 * What that cost, measured off a real screen:
 *
 *     93 Bimbadeen Avenue    10-Year ROI   160,902.0%
 *                            Equity Multiple  1,049.02x
 *                            Cash-on-Cash    -2,066.00%
 *
 * `compBaseData` read `mo.purchasePrice || fc.purchasePrice || fc.propertyValue`
 * and missed `initialCosts.propertyValue`, which is where that report keeps its
 * price — and it missed `initialCosts.stampDuty` and LMI the same way. So the
 * purchase price resolved to 0, the deposit fell back to `0 × (1 - LVR)` = 0,
 * stamp duty was 0, and the cost base collapsed to the **$2,000 solicitor-fee
 * default** that the old code substituted when none was recorded. Every return
 * was then a real dollar figure divided by two thousand dollars:
 * 3,218,039 / 2,000 = 160,902%. The property's own *projection* was correct
 * throughout; only the denominator was fiction.
 *
 * ## Three rules
 *
 * **A return needs a cost base, and a missing one is not a small one.** There
 * is no default here. When the capital committed cannot be established the
 * metrics are refused, and the table says so — because a plausible-looking
 * percentage is far worse than a blank, and this is a document an adviser puts
 * in front of a client.
 *
 * **The gain is measured over the ten years being projected.** It was
 * `projs[10].value - purchasePrice`, which for a property bought years ago
 * folds decades of past appreciation into a ten-year forecast. It is now
 * `projs[10].value - projs[0].value` — the first row of the table the reader is
 * looking at, to the last. For a property being bought today the two are
 * identical, which is why the primary property's figures do not move.
 *
 * **The denominator is the capital committed at the START of those ten years.**
 * For a purchase that is the cash outlay — deposit, duty, legal, LMI — because
 * the duty and fees are sunk into it. For a property already held it is the
 * equity in it today, which is what the next ten years are actually earned on.
 * The greater of the two is the one the investor has in it at year 0. Dividing
 * a ten-year gain on a $2.7m asset by a deposit paid two decades ago is how
 * 71 Saltwater Creek Road came to read 3,997%.
