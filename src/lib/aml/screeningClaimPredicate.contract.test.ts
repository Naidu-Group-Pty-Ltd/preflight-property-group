/**
 * Source-contract test for the screening claim predicate.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * The outbox worker claims a screening subject with a conditional UPDATE so
 * the provider runs at most once per delivery. That predicate was written as
 * one PostgREST `.or()` string with an ISO timestamp interpolated into it:
 *
 *     .or(`state.in.(queued,error),and(state.eq.processing,updated_at.lt.${cutoff})`)
 *
 * PostgREST could not parse it — a timestamp carries the `.` and `:` its
 * filter grammar treats as structural — so production answered
 * "column party_screening_subjects.state does not exist" and the claim
 * failed for every subject, every time, from the day it was written.
 *
 * It survived review because it reads correctly and because the consumer's
 * own test double implemented `.or()` by pulling the cutoff back out with a
 * regex. Both the code and its test agreed; only the server disagreed.
 *
 * ## What is asserted
 *
 * A filter may not be composed as a string, because a string is the only
 * form in which a value can silently corrupt the grammar around it. Typed
 * filters cannot: the client encodes each value for the position it is going
 * into. This is the same class as SQL string-building, and the remedy is the
 * same — never hand the parser a sentence you assembled yourself.
