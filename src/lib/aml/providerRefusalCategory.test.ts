/**
 * A typed refusal must reach the operator as the right remedy.
 *
 * ## The defect this pins
 *
 * There are three refusal codes and two consumers collapsed them with the
 * same hand-written ternary:
 *
 *     err.code === 'provider_misconfigured' ? 'provider_misconfigured'
 *                                           : 'provider_not_configured'
 *
 * which sent `simulator_blocked_in_production` to the "nothing is
 * configured" branch. Production's screening provider row is `local_lists`,
 * active, in `simulator` mode — configured, and unable to execute. So the
 * message the administrator would have been shown was "No screening provider
 * is configured for this tenant. An administrator must configure one": a
 * remedy that asks for a provider which already exists, while the real
 * remedy — finish configuring that one as live and load a list for it — is
 * never named.
 *
 * The distinction is the whole point of the two categories. **Not
 * configured** means there is nothing there to fix. **Misconfigured** means
 * something is there and is unfinished. Only the absence of a provider row
 * is the former.
