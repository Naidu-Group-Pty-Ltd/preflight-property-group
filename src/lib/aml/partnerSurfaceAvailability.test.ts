 * "The compliance workspace is not available."

 * ── What was actually happening ───────────────────────────────────────
 * The email was right, the link was right, the flags were on, the partner
 * was fully enrolled — membership active, organisation cross-referenced,
 * arrangement bound, matter linked — and the page still said no.
 *
 * The gate in front of it was asking a question a partner cannot ask.
 * `public.feature_flags` grants SELECT `TO authenticated`; a Finance,
 * Builder or Solicitor portal user is not a Supabase-auth user, so the
 * browser client is anon. RLS does not error on a role that matches no
 * policy — it FILTERS. The query returned `[]` with HTTP 200, `error` was
 * null, every flag coerced from `undefined` to `false`, and the page
 * announced itself unavailable while the server was ready to serve it.
 *
 * The same trap is documented on `useAmlV3Flags` and
 * `useBuilderStockMarketplaceFlag`. This is the third surface to hit it, so
 * these tests pin the rule rather than the symptom.
