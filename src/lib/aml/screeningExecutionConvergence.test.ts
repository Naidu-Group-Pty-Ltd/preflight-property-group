/**
 * A screening request must never come to rest on `queued`.
 *
 * ── What was measured ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Production, 2026-08-18. One subject, one case:
 *
 *   party_screening_subjects   state=queued  error_category=NULL
 *                              screening_check_id=NULL
 *                              updated_at=08:05:58   (27 minutes earlier)
 *   case_events                "Released a stalled screening request"
 *                              "Party screening queued"
 *                              …and nothing after it
 *   integration_outbox         6 × aml.screening.requested, attempts = 0
 *                              on every single one
 *   security_events            invalid_internal_signature × 2,839
 *
 * Both execution paths were dead and neither said so:
 *
 *   the WORKER never consumed one event — its cron invocation is rejected
 *   with `invalid_internal_signature`, so `attempts` never left 0;
 *
 *   the INLINE path ran, failed, and put the reason in a response field no
 *   surface reads — leaving the subject exactly as it found it.
 *
 * The stage then told the operator "nothing has picked it up", which was
 * false. Something had picked it up and the failure was discarded.
 *
 * These tests pin the rule that closes it: an attempt is judged by the
 * subject's own state afterwards, never by whether a promise rejected.
