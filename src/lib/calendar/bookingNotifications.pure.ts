/**
 * Who gets told about a booking, and who tells them.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * Two different systems emailed the two audiences, and neither knew about the
 * other. GoHighLevel emailed the CLIENT its own confirmation; this platform
 * emailed the additional contact and the finance partner. So the client alone
 * received no meeting notes, no call type and no Zoom link — reported as
 * "the client doesn't receive a zoom link… the client also doesn't receive
 * the notes whereas the additional contact and finance partner receives".
 *
 * The client was never a recipient here at all: the booking dialog carries a
 * CRM `contactId` and no email address, so there was nothing to send to even
 * if somebody had wanted to.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * **The platform owns the client notification.** Everyone invited to a
 * booking is notified by one sender, from one template, with the same facts —
 * so a Zoom link cannot reach three people and miss the fourth.
 *
 * That makes the feature work with **no CRM at all**: a booking made against
 * a locally-held client is announced exactly as one made against a CRM
 * contact. The CRM becomes a source of contact details rather than a
 * dependency of the notification.
 *
 * ## Three rules that bite
 *
 * - **"Nobody" is never an answer for the client.** If a deployment says the
 *   CRM sends client confirmations but no CRM is linked, the platform sends
 *   anyway. A setting that silently means "the customer is told nothing" is
 *   the failure this module exists to prevent.
 * - **One person, one email.** The client is frequently also an additional
 *   contact; the finance partner is sometimes both. Recipients are collapsed
 *   by address, keeping the most specific role, so nobody is told twice.
 * - **A missing address is reported, never dropped.** An operator who cannot
 *   see that the client has no email on file will assume they were told.
