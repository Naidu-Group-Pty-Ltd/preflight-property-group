/**
 * Audit item 33 — a cancellation reached only the client.
 *
 * The command centre set `appointmentStatus: 'cancelled'` on GoHighLevel and
 * stopped. GHL emails the client; the additional contact and the finance
 * partner — who were invited by `send-appointment-notification` — were told
 * nothing.
 *
 * These read the deployed source rather than sending anything. No mail leaves
 * this repository during a test run, which is the point: the assertions are
 * about the contract, and the contract is what makes the live behaviour safe.
