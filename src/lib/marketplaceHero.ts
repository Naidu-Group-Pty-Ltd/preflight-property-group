/**
 * THE MARKETPLACE HERO STANDARD — the drawing half. Byte-identical in the
 * Builder Portal and the Command Centre.
 *
 * It applies a plan; it never makes one. The plan is computed once, on the
 * network, from the served picture's own pixels
 * (`supabase/functions/_shared/builderStock/marketplaceHero.pure.ts`), handed
 * to the browser by the same door that signs the picture's URL, and drawn here
 * as percentages of the frame — so the SAME rectangle of the SAME picture
 * fills the card at every width, on a phone and on a desktop, in both portals.
 *
 * Nothing is re-encoded and nothing is stretched: an element sized to
 * `source / crop` of the frame and offset by `-crop.x / crop.w` shows exactly
 * the crop, at the picture's own aspect, because the crop is exactly 16:9 and
 * the frame is 16:9. `object-fit: cover` stays on the element as a guarantee
 * that rounding can never distort it.
 *
 * Whatever is not a well-formed plan — none, an older version, a shape that
 * does not match the picture that actually loaded — is IGNORED, and the card
 * draws exactly as it did before this standard. That is the rollback, and it
 * needs no deploy.
