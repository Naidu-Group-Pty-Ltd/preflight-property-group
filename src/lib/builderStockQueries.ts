 * image work, and it was the wrong owner in three separate ways, all three
 * measured in production on 29 August 2026.
 *
 *   IT COULD NOT FINISH. Every one of 29 consecutive calls returned the same

 *   stage was deadlocked against its own budget and the loop had no way to
 *   know. The modal sat on "Processing supplied images" for twenty minutes.

 *   IT COULD NOT SURVIVE. Call 30 was killed mid-request and returned no
 *   response at all, so the promise never settled and the dialog could never
 *   reach its own last line.
 *
 *   IT WAS NOT NEEDED. Through all of it the autonomous settler was claiming
 *   ONE property per cron tick and advancing it — twelve properties in the
 *   thirteen minutes after the browser stopped, with nobody watching. Source,
 *   eligibility, sanitization, the fallback ladder, primary selection and
 *   publication are all the backend's, and have been since the per-item claim
 *   shipped.
 *
 * So the loop is gone rather than budgeted. Raising a timeout or a request cap
 * would have kept the browser in charge of work it cannot own: the builder has
 * to be able to close the tab the moment the import answers, and after this
 * they can. What is left is reported — `imageWorkPending` — and never awaited.
