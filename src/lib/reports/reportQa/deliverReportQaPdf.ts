/**
 * Getting a typeset Q&A document into someone's hands — or into an email.
 *
 * ## Why this one hands back the bytes
 *
 * Because the path that matters most for this document does not download
 * anything. The toolbar's existing "Export PDF" posts the file into the
 * conversation as an assistant attachment (`ReportQA.tsx:2055`), which is what
 * `PDFAttachmentMessage.tsx` renders and what `InPlaceEmailCompose.tsx` sends.
 * A control that could only save to disk would leave the typeset document
 * unreachable from the one route that puts it in front of a person who is not
 * the adviser.
 *
 * So the route writes the attachment row and this module hands back the `Blob`,
 * and between them the new document reaches every destination the old one did.
 *
 * The signed URL is fetched rather than followed, for the same reason it is in
 * the other formats: a PDF that opens in a tab is a PDF someone has to find
 * again.
