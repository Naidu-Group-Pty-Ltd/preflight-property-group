/**
 * The Investment report PDF, drawn in the browser.
 *
 * This is the generation core of `PixelPerfectPDFGenerator` — pdf-lib, vector
 * text, embedded fonts, the cover, the tables, the disclaimer page — lifted out
 * of the React component **unchanged** so that two callers can share one
 * document rather than agreeing to produce the same one twice:
 *
 *  * the component itself, which still renders the button and still uploads;
 *  * `deliverInvestmentPdf`, the unified delivery contract every surface goes
 *    through (primary download, Send to Client, the premium button, the
 *    flatten copy).
 *
 * ## Why it stops at the Blob
 *
 * The component's `generateCore` used to upload to Supabase Storage and write
 * `pdf_url` itself, and `publishInvestmentPdf` does exactly the same thing at
 * the other end of the delivery contract. Sharing the generator without
 * splitting there would mean two uploads and two writes for one document. So
 * this returns the bytes and the name, and **storage is the caller's**:
 * `secureStorageUpload` → `manage-investment-reports` → `pdf_url`, once.
 *
 * ## What was NOT changed
 *
 * The drawing is byte-for-byte the code that produced 263 of the 275
 * Investment PDFs this product has delivered. No layout, no typography, no
 * section logic, no branding and no disclaimer wording moved. The only edits
 * this extraction required were a `useRef` that was a mutable map becoming a
 * plain one, and the return.

       * fetches — every tile is a stored value formatted.

       * omit a zero as well as a null, which is correct for these fields and is
       * this programme's "absent is never zero": measured over the 204 reports
       * carrying a `keyMetrics` block, none holds a zero price, rent or LVR,
       * and the five with a zero gross yield are the reports whose rent was
       * never established.
       *
       * The Financial tier is not flattened into Compass — it keeps its deeper
       * modelling, its extra sections and its specialist commentary. What it
       * stops having is a monopoly on the basic facts.

       * The band has always attached to a section whose NAME invites it, and
       * that is a fact about how the model happened to title its chapters:
       * measured over the corpus, only 141 of 1,123 Compass reports carry such
       * a heading — the rest run "Executive Verdict", "Property & Locality
       * Snapshot", "Why This Location Matters", none of which match. Removing
       * the tier suppression alone would therefore have left the basic
       * investment facts off seven documents in eight while the selected
       * templates kept showing them.
       *
       * So a report with no inviting section hosts the band on its FIRST
       * section. Purely additive: every document that draws the band today
       * draws it in the same place, and one that drew none now draws one.
