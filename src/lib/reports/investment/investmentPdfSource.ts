/**
 * The stored row a browser-drawn Investment PDF is built from.
 *
 * `investment_reports` and the generator speak different vocabularies —
 * `property_address` vs `address`, `report_content` vs `content`, four separate
 * jsonb columns vs one `enhanced_data` object — and something has to translate.
 * That translation lived inside `ClientPDFGenerator`, which was fine while a
 * React component was the only way to reach the generator.
 *
 * It is not fine now. `deliverInvestmentPdf` draws the same document without
 * mounting anything, and a second copy of this transform would be a second
 * opinion about **money**: the projection is where stored financials are healed
 * (`reconcileStoredFinancials`) and where an historic row's overrides are
 * overlaid (`overlayOverridesForHistoricRow`). Two copies drifting apart means
 * two documents for one report, differing in the numbers.
 *
 * So there is one transform, here, and both callers use it.
