/**
 * Asking for a URL-extract report's photographs to be kept — and making sure
 * the ask is not lost.
 *
 * The extraction names the listing's own photographs on its job
 * (`photographs.candidates`, from `listingPagePhotographs.pure.ts`); nothing is
 * fetched until a report exists to keep them for. Once the report row is
 * created this asks `listing-images` to fetch, check and file them under it
 * (`op: 'capture_report'`), and the report's documents then carry them through
 * the same broker as a listing's.
 *
 * Nothing here bounds how long the photographs take to arrive. The server
 * answers as soon as it has written down what was asked, and does the work
 * after that, so a tab that closes or a request that times out costs nothing.
 * Two things can still go wrong, and each has its answer here:
 *
 *  - The ask itself never lands — a dropped connection, a platform error, a
 *    rate limit. `startPhotographCapture` sends it again, a bounded number of
 *    times, and only for a failure a second try can cure; a refusal is final.
 *  - The work lands and is left unfinished — a host that did not answer, time
 *    that ran out. The broker then reports the capture `pending`, and the next
 *    document drawn asks for the rest first (`photographResumeRequest`),
 *    waiting a bounded time, so it carries what the capture keeps.
 *
 * Neither ever costs the report: a report without photographs is the ordinary
 * state of every report before this, and every photo slot prints nothing when
 * empty.
