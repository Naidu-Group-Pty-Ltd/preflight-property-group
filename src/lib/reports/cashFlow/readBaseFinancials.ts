/**
 * Reading a report's financial position out of the two places it is stored.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module rather than a `useMemo`
 *
 * It was one. `CashFlowAnalysisModal` built this object inline for the report
 * the adviser had open, and nothing built it for the properties they compared
 * that report against — so the comparison's metrics were computed from a
 * *different, shorter* reading (`compBaseData`), and the two disagreed in two
 * ways that a client would never have been able to see:
 *
 *  - **LMI.** The inline reading has `lmiAmount`; `compBaseData` has no such key.
 *    `totalInitialInvestment` is deposit + stamp duty + legal + LMI, and it is
 *    the denominator of return on capital, cash-on-cash and the equity multiple.
 *    So the property the adviser opened had its returns divided by a larger cost
 *    base than every property it was ranked against.
 *  - **Purchase price.** `compBaseData` reads
 *    `mo.purchasePrice || fc.purchasePrice || fc.propertyValue`, missing
 *    `initialCosts.propertyValue` — which the peer's own *projection* does read.
 *    Where the two differ, capital gain was measured from a base the projection
 *    never used. The `||` also turns a legitimate `0` into a fallback, which
 *    `??` does not.
 *
 * One implementation, called once per property, makes every column of a
 * comparison comparable by construction rather than by care. The modal's
 * `baseFinancialData` is this function; nothing about the report it has open
 * changed.
 *
 * ## The record is read where the calculator writes it
 *
 * `financial-calculator-service` persists the case NESTED — `income.weeklyRent`,
 * `annualCosts.councilRates`, `initialCosts.stampDuty`, `loanDetails.interestRate`
 * — and this reading looked for every one of them FLAT (`fc.weeklyRent`,
 * `fc.stampDuty`, …), keys the calculator has never written. Every one fell
 * through to `0` or to a hard-coded default, so the standalone 10-year cash
 * flow of 291 Stone Mason Drive (QA-291SM, 15 Sep 2026) ran with no rent, no
 * operating costs, no duty and no legal fees, at 5.5% instead of the record's
 * 6.5%, 7% fees instead of 7.5%, 52 weeks instead of 50 and $6,000 depreciation
 * instead of $10,000 — a zero-income financing model presented as the same
 * investment the sibling reports described (QA-01, QA-02, QA-03). The sibling
 * resolver in `financialSummary.ts` read the nested paths correctly the whole
 * time, which is how the card showed $900 a week beside a projection showing
 * a dash.
 *
 * The order is: the adviser's override, then the calculator's nested record,
 * then the flat legacy key a hand-saved row may carry, then a default. Every
 * field records which of those it came from (`provenance`), so a surface can
 * say "assumed" beside a figure nobody recorded, and a projection whose rent
 * or cost base is ABSENT is reported as incomplete rather than run as zero
 * (`missingInputs`). Absent is never zero; a default is never silent.
 *
 * ## The cascades are not tidy, and are not this module's to tidy
 *
 * `purchasePrice` has four sources and `capitalGrowth` has three because the
 * same figure has been saved under different shapes over the life of the
 * product. The order is load-bearing — it is the order the projection engine
 * itself resolves them in — so it is reproduced exactly rather than
 * rationalised. Changing it here changes every projection in the product.
