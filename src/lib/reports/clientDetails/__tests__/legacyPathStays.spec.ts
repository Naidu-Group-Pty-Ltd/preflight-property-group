/**
 * The legacy client details path is not deprecated, and this is what stops it.
 *
 * The stakes are higher here than for any format before it. This document is the
 * one the business actually *sends*: the first button on the client toolbar is
 * "Send to Finance", and it puts the file in a mortgage broker's portal. Break
 * that and the failure is outside the building.
 *
 * Two claims, asserted structurally on source, because that is the property that
 * matters and a behavioural test of one button says nothing about a 2,705-line
 * generator with three destinations:
 *
 *   1. `FormaraPDFGenerator` is still there, still rasterises with html2canvas
 *      into jsPDF, and all three of its destinations still work.
 *   2. The new path is genuinely additional — it draws no PDF of its own, reads
 *      nothing from the browser, and returns a Blob so it can reach the same two
 *      places the legacy reaches.
