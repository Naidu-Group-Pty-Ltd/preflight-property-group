/**
 * Getting a typeset client details report into someone's hands — or into an
 * email.
 *
 * ## Why this one hands back the bytes
 *
 * Every other `deliver*` module in the programme saves a file and returns a
 * summary. This one must also return the `Blob`, because the two paths that
 * matter most for this document do not download anything:
 *
 *  - **Send to Finance** base64s the PDF into `share-report-with-finance`, which
 *    puts it in the broker's Finance Portal;
 *  - **the email composer** takes the blob as an attachment
 *    (`ClientDetailsModal.tsx:178`).
 *
 * Both take a `Blob` from the legacy generator today. Handing back the same
 * thing is what lets the typeset document reach a broker rather than only a
 * downloads folder — which is the whole point of migrating this format, since a
 * broker is who reads it.
 *
 * The signed URL is fetched rather than followed for the same reason it is in
 * the other formats: a PDF that opens in a tab is a PDF someone has to find
 * again.
