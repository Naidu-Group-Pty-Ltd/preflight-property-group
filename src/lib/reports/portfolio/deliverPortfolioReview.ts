/**
 * Getting a Portfolio Performance Review into someone's hands.
 *
 * ## Two variants, and how they differ from the Snapshot's two
 *
 * `deliverSnapshot.ts` offers `server` and `legacy`, where `legacy` *runs* the
 * in-browser generator. This one cannot: `PortfolioAnalysisPDFGenerator` has no
 * importable entry point, so there is no function to call.
 *
 * So the second variant here is the **stored** legacy PDF — the file that
 * generator already produced and left at
 * `portfolio_analysis_reports.pdf_file_path`. Every existing item in the reports
 * list's row menu is `disabled={!report.pdf_file_path}` for exactly this reason,
 * and 7 of the 21 stored reports have no such file, which is why they are
 * un-downloadable today.
 *
 * The `server` variant reads `report_data` rather than the file, so those seven
 * become downloadable for the first time. That is a side effect of doing the
 * work properly rather than the point of it, but it is worth knowing.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * No fallback between them, in either direction. Asking for the typeset document
 * and receiving the legacy one — or the reverse — is handing someone a document
 * from a renderer they did not choose. The variant is a choice, and a failure in
 * either says which one failed.
