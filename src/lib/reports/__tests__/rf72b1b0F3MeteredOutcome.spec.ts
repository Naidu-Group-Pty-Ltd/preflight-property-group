/**
 * RF-7.2B.1B0-F3 — a refused vendor call must not be billed as a served one.
 *
 * Measured in production on 2026-09-12: 24 of 24 Google geocode attempts
 * answered `REQUEST_DENIED`, and `api_usage_log` recorded **all 24** as
 * `status = 'success'`. `meteredFetch` decides from `response.ok`, and Google
 * answers HTTP 200 with the real verdict in the body — the same trap
 * `resolveOneReportGeography` already records for the ABS boundary server.
 *
 * That is not merely cosmetic. Traced end to end:
 *
 *   meteredFetch  → api_usage_log.status = 'success'
 *   claim_api_usage_for_forwarding  → does NOT filter on status
 *   toReportableEvent → status 'success', quantity 1, googlemaps is per-REQUEST
 *   report-api-usage → forwarded to Mission Control as billable
 *
 * ...so a refused call is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a served one all the way to
 * the invoice, and every health surface read the vendor as perfectly well
 * throughout a total outage.
 *
 * ## What was NOT true, measured before claiming it
 *
 * The exposure is LATENT, not realised. Checked on 2026-09-12:
 *
 *   api_usage_log, googlemaps, all time  2,331 rows,  0 forwarded, 0 attempted
 *   api_usage_log, ALL services          109,800 rows, 0 forwarded, 0 attempted
 *   cron.job matching report-api-usage   (no rows)
 *
 * `report-api-usage` has never been scheduled on this deployment, so not one
 * usage row has ever reached Mission Control and **no customer credit, balance
 * or invoice was affected by the refused geocodes**. No reconciliation is owed.
 *
 * That does not make the defect cosmetic — it makes it a bill waiting to be
 * wrong. The moment forwarding is switched on, every historical row goes with
 * the status it was written with, and 2,331 googlemaps rows are already
 * standing there marked `success`. Fixing the write is what stops the queue
 * filling with the wrong answer; the unscheduled forwarder is a separate,
 * pre-existing gap and is recorded as backlog rather than chased here.
 *
 * The fix is opt-in and default-preserving: `judgeBody` lets a call site whose
 * vendor answers 200-with-error say so. Nothing that does not pass it changes.
