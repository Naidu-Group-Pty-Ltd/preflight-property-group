/**
 * 60 Lawley Street, Spalding WA 6530 — the Investment Compass of 25 Sep 2026.
 *
 * Every test below names a defect read off that delivered document (or the
 * prompt that wrote it) and drives the REAL module that produces the page:
 * the scoring engine, the binding projection, the strategy composers, the
 * read-path scrub every renderer applies, the planning and infrastructure
 * composers and the prompt blocks the generator pins. Nothing here is a copy
 * of the code it checks.
 *
 * Two kinds of test, and the difference matters:
 *
 *  - DEFECT tests fail on the revision the document was generated from
 *    (08296a305) and pass after the repair — each is the reproduction.
 *  - PRESERVATION tests (named so) pass on both revisions. They are here to
 *    show what did NOT move: above all the score, which the brief forbids
 *    this repair to change. The frozen-input pins were measured on 08296a305.
 *
 * The market values in the scoring fixture are the illustrative state-series
 * shape `gradeFollowsScore.spec.ts` already uses; they are not Lawley's own
 * figures, and nothing here asserts a grade the property holds.
