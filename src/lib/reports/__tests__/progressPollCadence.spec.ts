/**
 * Two idle dashboards asked the server 13,679 times in one day.
 *
 * Every answer was `returnedCount: 0`, every ask cost ~1.2s of database time
 * — about 4.5 database-hours a day spent saying "nothing is generating" —
 * and the only 5xx the projection returned all day were these polls hitting
 * resource limits. The cadence now adapts; this pins the shape it adapts in,
 * and that the widget actually goes through it.
