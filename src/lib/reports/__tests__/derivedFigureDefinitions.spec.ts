/**
 * A ratchet on the number of places that define a derived figure.
 *
 * Gross yield, net yield and LVR are each computed inline in more than a
 * dozen modules. That is not, by itself, a bug — most of the divergence is a
 * real distinction between two quantities that had never been given separate
 * names (yield on the purchase price versus yield on today's value;
 * origination LVR versus current LVR), which is why
 * `_shared/reports/metrics/propertyMetrics.pure.ts` names them rather than
 * collapsing them, and why nothing here rewrites a working call site.
 *
 * What it is is a slope. Stamp duty had exactly this shape and went from four
 * copies to four DIFFERENT answers — a South Australian band, three Tasmanian
 * rates and a quadratic Northern Territory modelled as linear — before anyone
 * compared them. This test does not forbid the copies that exist; it fixes
 * their number, so the next one has to be a decision somebody makes rather
 * than a line somebody adds.
 *
 * Adding an entry, or raising a count, is not automatically wrong. It is a
 * question with an answer: could this call the canonical module instead? If it
 * genuinely could not — because the quantity is different, or the shape of the
 * inputs is different — say which in the commit and move the number.

 *
 * That one movement is a ratchet DOWN, and it is the answer to the question
 * the header asks. The modal held 8 definitions because it held the 10-year
 * projection TWICE — once for the report a client receives and once for the
 * properties it is compared against — so gross yield, net yield and LVR were
 * each written out twice in one file. The two engines are now one,
 * `src/lib/cashFlow/projectionEngine.pure.ts`, and the same three figures are
 * defined once: 8 becomes 4, and the modal leaves this list entirely.
 *
 * They stay defined there rather than calling `propertyMetrics.pure.ts`
 * because the engine's quantities are the CURRENT-year ones — rent and
 * expenses against the year's grown value, and the amortised balance against
 * it — computed inside the chained loop that produces them, which is the
 * distinction that module exists to keep rather than collapse.
