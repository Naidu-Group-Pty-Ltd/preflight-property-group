/**
 * Stage 2 — two rules about the document rather than the data.
 *
 * Both were found by rendering a real production report and reading it:
 * `28 Bligh Street, Muswellbrook NSW 2333`, 5 Sep 2026, compass-40, the shape
 * the generator writes today.
 *
 *  1. A render that LOST content says so. The machinery to detect it already
 *     existed and every caller discarded the answer.
 *  2. Two services measure the same distance; the one the record keeps is the
 *     one the prose quotes.
 *
 * As in Stage 1, the adoption-safety cases carry more weight than the new
 * behaviour: a clean document must report nothing, and a school the record does
 * not name must keep the distance it arrived with.
