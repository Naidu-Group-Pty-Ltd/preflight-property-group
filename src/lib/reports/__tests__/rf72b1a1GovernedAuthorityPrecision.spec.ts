 * RF-7.2B.1A.1 — precision of the governed-authority enforcement.

 * RF-7.2B.1A made `blocking: true` a real refusal on both renderers and the
 * portal. The first production run through the real pipeline (backend report
 * a6f0693c, 48 Redfern Street Cowra NSW 2794, geography unresolved) then
 * showed the enforcement blocking FOUR units of legitimate prose and one real
 * fabrication. Left alone, that refuses correct reports at the delivery gate —
 * and the worst of the four was the model's own correct disclosure that the
 * data could not be established, which the directive explicitly asks for.
 *
 * Every string marked "PRODUCTION" below is verbatim from that report.
