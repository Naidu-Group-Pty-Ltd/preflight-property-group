/**
 * The generation engine is STATED where it cannot be chosen, RESOLVED by one
 * rule, and RECORDED as the one that ran.
 *
 * The Investment Analysis page carried a two-option "Generation Engine"
 * dropdown that defaulted to "Legacy Compass — Stable". That selection could
 * never take effect. The page sends no `reportTier`, so the generator defaults
 * the tier to `compass`; `isCompassTier` then resolves the engine to Compass
 * every time — deliberately, because the tier is the data-minimisation
 * boundary and an engine preference must not be able to pull financial content
 * into a non-financial report, nor strip it out of a financial one.
 *
 * So every report from that page has always been produced by the Compass
 * engine, whatever the dropdown said — and because `generation_engine` was
 * written only by the browser, the row then recorded the *unused selection*.
 * 1,124 compass-tier rows read "legacy" about documents this engine made.
 *
 * Three rules follow, and this file pins them. **A dead control is worse than
 * no control** — the rule this repository already applies to the AUSTRAC path
 * card — and this one was worse than dead, because it defaulted to the option
 * that never ran and called it "battle-tested". **A record of what was
 * requested is not a record of what happened**: the column now states the
 * engine that actually ran. And **the tier decides**, in one module that
 * mirrors the server's own expression, so a surface can say which engine will
 * run without re-deriving the rule and drifting from it.
