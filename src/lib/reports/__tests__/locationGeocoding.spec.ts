/**
 * The location geocoder — the question it asks, and the answers it refuses.
 *
 * Every figure in a report's location section is measured *from a
 * coordinate*: the amenity counts, the nearest school, the walk score, the
 * CBD commute. A wrong coordinate does not make those fail. It makes them
 * describe somewhere else, accurately, with nothing in the numbers for a
 * reader to catch — which is why this was invisible for the whole life of the
 * product and why it is worth a spec of its own.
 *
 * Measured over the 1,112 stored investment reports carrying a coordinate:
 *
 *   183 outside Australia   (16.5%)
 *    64 exactly Sydney CBD  ( 5.8%)  — the old failure value, to 4 decimals
 *
 * Every fixture below is a real stored coordinate with the real address that
 * produced it. They are not invented points, because an invented point proves
 * only that the assertion matches the fixture.
