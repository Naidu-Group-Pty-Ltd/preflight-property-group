/**
 * RF-7.2B.1B1 — a deterministic location enrichment is bought once per report.
 *
 * An investment report is resumed repeatedly by a two-minute cron, and the
 * enrichment block ran on every one of those invocations because
 * `existingEnhancedFields.locationIntelligence` guarded the WRITE and nothing
 * guarded the FETCH. One enrichment is eight Google calls (1 geocode + 6 Places
 * Nearby + 1 Distance Matrix — the production ledger's 612:102 Places:Distance
 * ratio over 2026-09-05..08 is exactly 6:1). The 2026-09-12 health check
 * resumed eleven times, so on a working geocode that is 88 calls for one
 * report, 80 of them re-buying an answer that cannot change.
 *
 * These tests are the §8 matrix: A–I, in order.
