/**
 * Stage 3 — the derived reports agree with the record, and with each other.
 *
 * Three defects, all found by running the current engine against a real parent
 * row (`1/27D Mitchell Street`, `0478c410`) rather than by reading the corpus:
 * every one of the 71 stored children predates the September fixes, so the
 * stored documents cannot testify about the code that runs today.
 *
 *  1. **One annual rent.** The projection published `weeklyRent ×
 *     occupancyWeeks` under the bare name `annualRent`, beside a yield computed
 *     on 52 weeks.
 *  2. **The Snapshot composed nothing**, while its siblings composed 7 and 8
 *     sections — and four of its nine model-authored sections were numeric.
 *  3. **Composed sections were appended**, so the Briefing's financial tables
 *     printed after its recommendation and after its sources appendix.
 *
 * As in Stages 1 and 2 the adoption-safety cases carry the most weight: a
 * record with no occupancy assumption must behave as it did, a tier with
 * nothing composed must come out unchanged, and nothing may be dropped to fix
 * an order.
