/**
 * One contract, enforced for every format at once.
 *
 * Each round of this programme fixed a hole that existed because a format was
 * wired *nearly* all the way: an adapter with no lister, a `variant` nothing
 * passed, a route that rendered a refusal, a picker whose choice the generator
 * ignored. Every one of them was invisible per-format and obvious across
 * formats, which is what this file is for — a tenth format cannot be added half
 * wired, and a ninth cannot quietly lose a half it already had.
 *
 * The rules, in the order they bite:
 *
 *  1. A production format has an adapter that can list, route and bind.
 *  2. Its delivery path asks for a templated document before rendering its own
 *     way, so activating a template actually changes the document.
 *  3. That request carries the **person's chosen template**, because the picker
 *     offers a choice for every format and says it is kept.
 *  4. A format whose choice cannot change anything says so, rather than
 *     offering a choice that does nothing.
