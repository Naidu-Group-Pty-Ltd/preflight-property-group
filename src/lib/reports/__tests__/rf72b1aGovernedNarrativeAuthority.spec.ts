/**
 * RF-7.2B.1A — GOVERNED NARRATIVE AUTHORITY.
 *
 * The prose fixtures below are VERBATIM from two reports this pipeline
 * generated in production on 2026-09-11, both of which recorded
 * `market.demographics` as `absent` in `market_fact_snapshot` and then stated
 * demographic figures anyway:
 *
 *   09f8569e-21ca-48b9-a3b9-57f4793d0836   48 Redfern Street, Cowra NSW 2794
 *   3fbbcfe6-eaad-490c-a10d-cfaa757820f5   28 Bligh Street, Muswellbrook NSW 2333
 *
 * They are kept as regression evidence rather than paraphrased, because the
 * detector has to survive the sentences that actually occurred — footnote
 * markers, en-dashed ranges, `{{…}}` visual directives and all. Muswellbrook's
 * claimed figures disagree with the record the platform holds for POA 2333
 * (population 13,795, median age 36, median household income $1,640/wk), which
 * is what makes the false attribution the serious half of the defect.
