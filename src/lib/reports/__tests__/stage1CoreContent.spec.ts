/**
 * Stage 1 — three rules the core reporting content depends on.
 *
 * Each was found by execution against the live corpus on 2026-09-07, not by
 * reading code, and each is the same class of defect: the record knows
 * something the report does not use, or does not know something the report
 * asserts anyway.
 *
 *  1. A yield rests on a rent. Where none is established the yield is absent.
 *  2. WHO is buying decides the duty scale, and the request already says.
 *  3. WHAT is being bought decides the duty category, and the request already
 *     says that too.
 *
 * The adoption-safety cases matter more than the new behaviour: these rules
 * sit on paths every investment report takes, so the bar is "a report with a
 * recorded rent, an owner-occupier buyer or an established dwelling resolves
 * to exactly what it resolved to before".
