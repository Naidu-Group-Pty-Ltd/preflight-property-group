/**
 * The address a report is filed under, composed from what a scrape extracted.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for
 *
 * Scraping a realestate.com.au listing at
 * `…/property-house-nsw-bowral-152220352` confirmed `✓ Scraped: 6 Acer Court`.
 * The suburb, state and postcode were extracted too — they are in the same
 * response, and the form fields below were populated from them — but the
 * address took `extractedAddress` verbatim and stopped there.
 *
 * It was reported as a display defect and is not one. That string becomes
 * `property_address` on the generated report, its title, the activity log's
 * entity name and the notification text, so every report generated from a URL
 * was filed under a street line with no locality. Two different properties can
 * share "6 Acer Court", and this product already has eleven City Beach
 * listings whose street numbers never got extracted — an address without its
 * suburb is not an address.
 *
 * ## The rules
 *
 * 1. **Use every part that was extracted.** The parts are all present; the
 *    only reason they were discarded is that `extractedAddress` was truthy.
 * 2. **Never repeat a part the address already carries.** A scraper that
 *    returns the full address for one site and the street line for another is
 *    the normal case, so this has to be idempotent — appending blindly gives
 *    "6 Acer Court, Bowral NSW 2576, Bowral NSW 2576".
 * 3. **Compose, never invent.** Nothing here supplies a part that was not
 *    extracted, and a scrape that yielded nothing falls back exactly as it did
 *    before — to the page title, then to the source.
