/**
 * What reports exist for a client, and which of them can be put on the portal.
 *
 * A client's finished work is scattered across five tables — `client_files`
 * (client-detail forms and property reports), `investment_reports`,
 * `portfolio_analysis_reports`, `borrowing_capacity_assessments` and
 * `client_portal_reports` — and the Reports tab already merged all five into
 * one list. This module is that merge, lifted out so the Sent Reports tab can
 * offer the same set without building a second one beside it. Two lists of the
 * same reports is how one comes to be missing a source nobody noticed.
 *
 * It also answers the question the picker exists to ask: **can this report be
 * put in front of the client right now?** That is not the same as "is it
 * finished". Three different answers are possible and each needs saying:
 *
 *   • `ready`      — a file is stored and the portal can be pointed at it.
 *   • `on_publish` — nothing is stored, but publishing renders one. This is
 *                    the borrowing capacity assessment, which has no PDF until
 *                    somebody asks for one.
 *   • `unavailable`— there is nothing to publish and nothing that would make
 *                    one: a report still generating, one that failed, or a
 *                    reference that points at a host this deployment cannot
 *                    sign. Offering it would produce the "No PDF available to
 *                    send" dead end that the row action gives today.
 *
 * The rule that matters most here is the LAST one. A stored reference is not
 * automatically a file the portal can serve: `storageRef.ts` records four
 * different shapes these columns have been written in over the years, two of
 * them absolute URLs, and one of those pointing at a `/object/public/` route
 * on a bucket that is private. Publishing such a reference produces a portal
 * row that looks healthy in every list and fails on the client's click. So the
 * reference is parsed BEFORE it is offered, and one that cannot be resolved is
 * declared unavailable rather than published and discovered later.
