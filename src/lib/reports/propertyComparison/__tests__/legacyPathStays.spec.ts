/**
 * The legacy comparison path is not deprecated, and this is what stops it.
 *
 * The stakes are higher here than for the three formats before it. The comparison
 * PDF is drawn by `PixelPerfectPDFGenerator` — 3,626 lines of pdf-lib **shared
 * with the investment report format** — so retiring or breaking it takes a
 * second, unrelated document down with it, and no test elsewhere would fail.
 *
 * Two claims, asserted structurally on source rather than through renders,
 * because that is the property that matters and a behavioural test of one button
 * cannot say anything about a shared engine and four mount sites:
 *
 *   1. The generator, the engine, the formatter edge function and every mount
 *      site are still there and still wired together.
 *   2. The new path is genuinely additional — it never imports either component,
 *      never invokes the formatter, is not metered, and writes nothing back.
