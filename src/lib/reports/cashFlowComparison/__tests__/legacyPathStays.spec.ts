/**
 * The legacy comparison path is not deprecated — and this time it was also
 * repaired, which is a harder pair of claims to hold at once.
 *
 * Every format before this one asserted only the first half. Here the user asked
 * for the five field-name defects to be fixed, so the file the migration was
 * meant not to touch has been touched. Both halves are asserted structurally on
 * source, because that is the property that matters: a behavioural test of one
 * button says nothing about whether a second generator two thousand lines away
 * still exists.
 *
 *   1. `exportComparisonPDF` and `exportAiAnalysisPDF` are still there, still
 *      drawing with jsPDF, still bound to their buttons, and the producer they
 *      read is still the only one.
 *   2. Each of the five wrong field names is gone and each of the five right
 *      ones is there.
 *   3. The new path is genuinely additional — it imports neither generator,
 *      neither PDF library, and is not metered.
