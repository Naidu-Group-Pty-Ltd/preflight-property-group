/**
 * Getting a Borrowing Capacity Snapshot into someone's hands.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Four call sites each had their own copy of the same twelve lines: create an
 * anchor, set `download`, append it to the body, click it, remove it, remember
 * to revoke the object URL — but only when the blob was one we made. Two of the
 * four forgot the revoke. That is not a bug worth four fixes; it is a function.
 *
 * ## The variant, and why it is a parameter
 *
 * `requestSnapshot.ts` treats the legacy generator as a *deployment* fallback:
 * reached only when the render function is absent, and never otherwise. That was
 * right for landing the new path and wrong as a resting state — the moment the
 * function is deployed, the generator that has produced this document for the
 * life of the product becomes unreachable from every button in the app. Nobody
 * decided to retire it; it would simply have stopped happening.
 *
 * So the choice is explicit here. `variant: 'server'` is the default everywhere
 * and still carries the undeployed-fallback, because that is a different
 * situation with a different answer. `variant: 'legacy'` is a person choosing
 * the layout they know, and it is offered beside the other on every surface that
 * produces this document.
