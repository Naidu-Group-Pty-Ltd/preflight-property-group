/**
 * Asking the server for a Borrowing Capacity Snapshot.
 *
 * One function behind every button that produces this document. The five call
 * sites currently each build the PDF in the browser with jsPDF; this replaces
 * that with a request, and the server decides what the document says.
 *
 * ## The fallback, and why it is here at all
 *
 * `render-borrowing-capacity-pdf` has to be deployed, and the migration it
 * depends on has to be applied, before it can answer. Those are manual steps.
 * Between merging this and doing them, every one of those buttons would fail.
 *
 * So a missing function — and *only* a missing function — falls back to the
 * generator that ships today, and **says so**. That is not the silent downgrade
 * the render path refuses: a WeasyPrint failure inside the new path still fails
 * the request, because a lesser renderer would produce a document nobody
 * approved. This is a deployment gap, the fallback is exactly what the product
 * did yesterday, and the caller is told which one they got.
 *
 * Delete `legacyFallback` once the function is deployed. It has one job and it
 * is finished the moment that is true.

// The predicate is shared (`../undeployedRoute`). This module carried its own
// copy which could not match the message the transport actually produces for an
// absent function, so the in-browser generator handed in as `legacyFallback`
// was never called and the person got an error and NO FILE. The bare-404 rule
// that comment defended is preserved there: only a missing *function* counts,
// never a 404 the route itself answered for a client the caller may not see.

/**
 * Request the document.
 *
 * `legacyFallback` is invoked only when the route is absent; it is passed in
 * rather than imported so this module does not drag the whole jsPDF generator
