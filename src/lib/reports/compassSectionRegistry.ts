/**
 * Compass Section Registry — Frontend mirror
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Edge functions cannot import from `src/`, so this file duplicates
 * `supabase/functions/_shared/compassSectionRegistry.ts` by design.
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT EITHER COPY ALONE. `compassRegistryParity.spec.ts` compares the
 * two section arrays field by field and fails the build on any divergence —
 * they had drifted to 672 lines against 174 with nothing checking, which is
 * what docs/reports/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md records as the cautionary case.
 *
 * Everything above COMPASS_FINANCIAL_HANDOFF_COPY is a verbatim copy of the
 * edge file. Below it are the two helpers only the frontend needs
 * (`normaliseReportTier`, `sectionCountForTier`); the edge file likewise keeps
 * `HEADING_ROUTING` / `routeHeading`, which the frontend does not use.

// ─── Investment Location & Property Fit Report (≈23 pages, 11 sections) ─────
// v3.0 — the commentary strip. ALL detailed financial modelling (purchase
// costs, yield, loan, cashflow, sensitivity, 10-year projections, land tax,
// equity) lives in the separate Financial Analysis Report and MUST NOT appear
// here; that rule is unchanged from v2.0.
//
// WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY
//
// v2.0 declared a 4-block writing style for every narrative section — Key
// takeaway / Why this matters / What to watch / NPC view — and the generator
// separately told the model to add a "What This Means" paragraph after *every*
// visual, table and data point. Measured against the 56 most recent reports,
// that produced **90 editorial labels a report carrying 16.9% of the
// document**, against a declared budget the report was already exceeding by
// 2.3× (86 rendered pages, ~21,000 words, against 45 declared pages and 9,170
// words).
//
// The writing style is now:
//   1. State the finding in the sentence that introduces the data.
//   2. Show the data — a figure, a table, or a short list.
//   3. Move on.
//
// There is no commentary block, and no paragraph that restates the figure
// above it. See EDITORIAL_LABELS for the exact strings this forbids and the
// two modules that enforce it.
//
// The section list is 11 client-facing sections plus back matter, down from
// 17. Two merges: Demand Drivers absorbs population, tenant/buyer and
// employment (one question — who wants to live here, and why); Amenity &
// Access absorbs education, retail/healthcare/lifestyle and transport (one
// question — what is nearby, and how long to reach it). Both are
// consolidations the v2.0 `purpose` strings already asked for and the prompt
// could not deliver, because each was a separate section. Client Reading Guide
// is gone: it was a prose contents page, and the typeset document has a real
// one.
//
// A section name here is load-bearing downstream — `TITLED_SECTION_CHARTS` in
// reports/investment/normalise.pure.ts attaches infographics by title, and
// reportSplitRegistry.ts routes derived variants by heading substring. Both
// were updated with this list; read those two before renaming anything.
