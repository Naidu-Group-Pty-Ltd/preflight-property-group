/**
 * Cross-portal session isolation.
 *
 * Five apps share one Supabase project, so every Edge Function is reached at
 * the same `*.supabase.co` origin and therefore shares ONE cookie jar. The only
 * thing keeping five sessions apart in a single browser is that each portal
 * writes, reads and clears a cookie name nobody else touches.
 *
 * That rule was documented on `createFinanceSessionCookie` and honoured by the
 * Finance, Solicitor and Builder portals — but not by the Client Portal, and
 * not by two Finance functions. The failures only appear when one person holds
 * accounts in more than one portal and uses them from the same browser, which
 * is precisely what happens while the same addresses are registered across
 * portals for testing. They surface as the Command Centre losing a session it
 * still holds, as a portal sign-out ending an unrelated session, or as a valid
 * portal user being told "Authentication required".
 *
 * These are source-level assertions rather than live HTTP tests because the
 * defect is entirely in which cookie name each function names — the property is
 * fully decidable from the source, and a live test would need five real
 * sessions to prove the same thing.
