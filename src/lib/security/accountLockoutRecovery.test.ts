/**
 * Account lockout must stay recoverable.
 *
 * Every sign-in surface in this deployment locks an account for a few minutes
 * after five failed attempts. The lockout is only defensible while the owner
 * can still get back in, and that depends on two properties that are easy to
 * lose independently and were both lost on the Command Centre:
 *
 *   1. A password reset RELEASES the lock. The person resetting is, almost by
 *      definition, the person who just tripped it — they could not sign in, so
 *      they tried until the counter ran out. If the reset writes only
 *      `password_hash`, the new password is refused for the rest of the window
 *      and the reset looks like it silently failed. The four portals cleared
 *      the counters here; `admin-password-reset` did not.
 *
 *   2. A locked account SAYS it is locked. Command Centre answered a locked
 *      account and a wrong password with the same 401 "Invalid username or
 *      password", so the one state a reset cannot fix was indistinguishable
 *      from the one it can — and the owner reset again, and again.
 *
 * Together those two produced an account that could not be recovered by any
 * sequence its owner could perform, while every individual endpoint reported
 * itself working.
 *
 * These are source-level assertions for the same reason as
 * `crossPortalSessionIsolation.test.ts`: the property is entirely decidable
 * from what each function writes and returns, and a live test would need a real
 * mailbox and a real fifteen-minute lockout to prove it.

 * assertion pulls in the shared modules an entrypoint reaches, and those
