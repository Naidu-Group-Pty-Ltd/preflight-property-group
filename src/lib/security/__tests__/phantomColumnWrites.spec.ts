/*
  A COLUMN THE TABLE DOES NOT HAVE, ON THE WRITE SIDE.

  `aml.cases` taught this repository the read half: PostgREST answers 42703,
  the discarded error leaves `data` null, and a missing column reads exactly
  like a missing row. The WRITE half is worse and was still open on 13 Sep
  2026 — an unknown key in a payload is PGRST204 and fails the whole
  statement, so the row simply never exists.

  Five sites were live, every one of them verified against
  `information_schema.columns` on the prime rather than against the generated
  types, and each is pinned below by the name it must not use again.

  `check-edge-column-names.mjs` could see NONE of them until it was widened in
  the same change: it matched a write body with `[^{}]*`, so a payload carrying
  a template literal was skipped outright, and it skipped a payload bound to a
  `const` altogether. Both shapes are now read. This file is the second guard,
  because a regex-based gate is one refactor away from losing sight of a call
  site while the defect stays.
