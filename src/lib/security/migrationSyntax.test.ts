/**
 * No migration in this corpus may use syntax PostgreSQL rejects.
 *
 * Two migrations were written with `CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS`, which
 * PostgreSQL has never supported in any version — `CREATE POLICY` has no
 * `IF NOT EXISTS` clause. Every one of the 23 statements across those files
 * was a parse error (42601), verified against PostgreSQL 17, so neither
 * migration could ever have run.
 *
 * That was survivable only by accident. Clone backends are built by catalog
 * introspection (`replicateSchemaByIntrospection`) and have the prime's
 * migration ids stamped into their ledger, so historical files are skipped
 * rather than replayed. But `applyPrimeMigrations` — which Mission Control
 * uses to push INCREMENTAL migrations onto every existing clone — halts on
 * the first failure. A new migration copying this pattern therefore stops
 * schema sync for the entire fleet, and the pattern is exactly the kind that
 * gets copied from a neighbouring file.
 *
 * Kept narrow deliberately: these are forms the grammar rejects outright, not
 * a style opinion. A check that argues about taste is one people learn to
 * silence.
