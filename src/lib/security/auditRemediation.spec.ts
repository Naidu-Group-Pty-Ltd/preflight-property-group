/**
 * Security audit remediation — 12 September 2026.
 *
 * A read-only audit of the live project found four authorisation defects and
 * made two recommendations that were WRONG. This file pins both halves,
 * because the second half is the one that costs an outage if somebody later
 * "finishes the job" from the audit report alone.
 *
 * Fixed, and asserted below:
 *
 *   F-01  `_report_templates_backup_20260906` sat in the PostgREST-exposed
 *         `public` schema with RLS off and the default grants, so the anon key
 *         — inlined into every browser bundle — could SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
 *         and TRUNCATE it. Verified live: HTTP 206 with rows, unauthenticated.
 *
 *   F-02  Three operator backfills ran with `verify_jwt = false`, no caller
 *         check, a service-role client and CORS `*`. Two of them spend the
 *         organisation's Microsoft Graph and GoHighLevel credentials.
 *
 *   F-06  `tpl_comments_update_own_or_resolve` ended in `OR true`.
 *
 *   F-07  `gc_pdf_import_jobs` deleted from `storage.objects`, which the
 *         platform rejects — rolling the whole function back on all 59 runs
 *         since 15 July, so the job-timeout sweep in the same function never
 *         committed either.
 *
 * NOT done, and asserted below as a guard:
 *
 *   The audit recommended revoking `EXECUTE` on the anon-callable
 *   SECURITY DEFINER role oracles. Doing that takes the platform down: those
 *   functions are called from inside RLS predicates, a policy is evaluated as
 *   the querying role, and 176 live policies depend on them.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE LIVES IN `src/lib/security/`.
 *
 * It was written in `src/lib/__tests__/`, where CI never would have run it.
 * The only step naming that directory is `npx vitest run
 * src/lib/__tests__/builderStock src/lib/__tests__/builderPortal`, and vitest
 * matches those positionally as path substrings — so the guard above, the one
 * whose whole purpose is to stop somebody taking the authorisation layer down
 * by "finishing the audit", would have been green by never executing.
 *
 * That is the failure ci.yml already records twice in its own comments, once
 * for the Cloudflare worker and once for the cash-flow specs: "a guard nobody
 * runs still reads as coverage". Its stated remedy is not to extend a list —
 * "a list that has to be edited to stay correct will be wrong again" — so this
 * moved into a directory CI already runs whole (`npx vitest run
 * src/lib/security`) rather than adding a fourteenth path to the argv.

 * ─── THE GUARD ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured on the live catalogue, 12 September 2026:
 *
 *     has_any_aml_role             57 policies
 *     current_user_can_*           39 policies
 *     has_role                     33 policies
 *     has_aml_write_role           21 policies
 *     has_aml_role                 17 policies
 *     can_access_client_fact_find   9 policies
 *
 * An RLS policy is evaluated as the querying role, so revoking EXECUTE makes
 * every one of those 176 policies raise `permission denied for function`
 * instead of returning a boolean. The authorisation layer does not fail open —
 * it fails, everywhere, at once.
 *
 * The residual risk is accepted and small: a caller who already knows a user's
 * UUID can learn whether that user holds a role. The escalation this class
 * usually carries is already closed, because every SECURITY DEFINER function
 * in `public` and `aml` pins its `search_path` — zero exceptions, verified.
