/*
  ONE SHAPE FOR A CONVERSATION AND A MESSAGE.

  These mappers existed in four copies. Two call sites writing the same message
  through two copies of `mapMessageDirection` is how one message comes to be
  `inbound` on the scheduled path and `outbound` on the browser's refresh, with
  `onConflict: 'ghl_message_id'` making whichever ran last the winner.

  The column sets below are pinned against the LIVE tables rather than against
  the migrations, because a migration in this repository
  (`20260723150000_conversation_message_delivery_safety.sql`) adds three
  columns and has never been applied to any database in the fleet — so "named
  by a migration" is not evidence a column exists. `check-edge-column-names.mjs`
  judges the generated types UNION the migrations and therefore cannot see
  this; a row assembled in a mapper module is invisible to it in any case.
