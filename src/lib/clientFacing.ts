/**
 * Client-facing deployment mode.
 *
 * One build of this dashboard serves two audiences: the internal operations
 * console (everything on), and client-facing deployments where the
 * developer/operator tooling — integration credential management, the workflow
 * playground, engine diagnostics, test-data controls — must not appear at all.
 *
 * The mode is decided per BUILD by `VITE_CLIENT_FACING` and nothing else.
 * Unlike `editorV2Flag` / `templateLibrary` there is deliberately no URL-param
 * or localStorage override: those exist so an operator can flip a feature for
 * one visit, and the whole point of a client-facing deployment is that a
 * visitor cannot flip the operator tooling back on from the address bar.
 * Default OFF — a build that never heard of the flag behaves exactly as today.
 *
 * This flag controls VISIBILITY, never data access. Module permissions,
 * workspace entitlements and the edge functions' own auth checks enforce
 * access independently of it; hiding a surface here changes no server
 * behaviour. In particular, hiding the Integrations page does not touch the
 * Make.com → Airtable "Property Intake Master" pipeline — that runs entirely
 * server-side and never depended on this UI being visible.
 *
 * Both the navigation filter (src/hooks/useNavigation.ts) and the route gate
 * (src/components/auth/ClientFacingGate.tsx) read the ONE list below, so what
 * is unlinked and what is unroutable cannot drift apart.
