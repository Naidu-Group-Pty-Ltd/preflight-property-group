/**
 * Builder stock — the production blackout, and the two things that caused it.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENED. The display gate went live and every Marketplace card went
 * blank, including properties whose builder photograph is perfectly clean. The
 * gate is right — an image with no display verdict is not displayable — and it
 * is safe only if the backfill that writes those verdicts actually runs. It did
 * not, for two independent reasons, and each of them reported success:
 *
 *   1  THE SCHEMA WAS NOT THERE. Edge functions ship automatically when `main`
 *      moves; migrations in this project are dispatched by hand, one file at a
 *      time. So the gate shipped and the settlement columns did not. The
 *      settler read a column that did not exist, could not tell that from an
 *      empty queue, and answered `success: true, skipped: 'marker_unavailable'`
 *      — a green report of work it had not done.
 *
 *   2  AND HAD IT RUN, IT WOULD HAVE MADE THINGS WORSE. Primary-image
 *      enforcement ran for every organisation the tick ATTEMPTED, and decided
 *      each item by reading verdicts. An item whose verdict had not been
 *      written yet therefore looked like an item with nothing to show, and its
 *      pointer was cleared — after which the backfill would write `eligible`
 *      onto an image nothing pointed at.
 *
 * The fix for the first is that a missing schema is now a named operational
 * failure. The fix for the second is that enforcement decides only where the
 * evidence is in: per ITEM, because one property's images can come from several
 * uploads, so "this upload settled" and "this property's candidates have all
 * been judged" are different statements and only the second licenses a write.
 *
 * None of this weakens the rule. Unjudged is still hidden.
