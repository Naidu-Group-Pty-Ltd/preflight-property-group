/**
 * Contract tests for staff push notifications.
 *
 * The pipeline was fully built and had never delivered a single push. Three
 * independent blockers, each silent:
 *
 * 1. THE TRIGGER READ A DIFFERENT TABLE'S COLUMNS.
 *    `dispatch_web_push_on_notification` opens with
 *    `IF NEW.user_id IS NULL THEN RETURN NEW; END IF;` and later reads
 *    `NEW.link_url` and `NEW.category`. `public.notifications` has none of
 *    those — they are the client-portal notification columns. plpgsql resolves
 *    record fields at runtime, so the first statement raised on every insert,
 *    and a bare `EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN RETURN NEW` discarded it. Verified
 *    against production: the offending fields are exactly
 *    `category, link_url, user_id`.
 *
 * 2. THE TRIGGER COULD NOT AUTHENTICATE.
 *    It sent `Authorization: Bearer <anon key>` — hardcoded as a literal in the
 *    function body — while `send-web-push` requires an internal credential. Even
 *    a well-formed call would have been refused 401.
 *
 * 3. NO DEVICE COULD EVER SUBSCRIBE.
 *    `pushNotifications.ts` called `push-subscribe` through
 *    `supabase.functions.invoke`, which sends the anon key and NO cookies, so
 *    `verifyAuth` found no session and returned 401. `push_subscriptions` has
 *    been empty since the feature shipped — zero rows, all subscriber types.
 *
 * Plus mobile: iOS only delivers Web Push to an INSTALLED PWA, and the manifest
 * declared a 48x48 `.ico` as its 192px and 512px icons, which fails
 * installability outright.

   * This asserted `verifyRequiredCronSecret` was present, and WP-12 removed

   * `x-internal-edge-secret` first and fall back to the signed check, and a
   * bearer-style shared secret is replayable, carries no caller identity and
   * binds nothing to the body. Both callers —

   * already build their headers with `public.cron_signed_internal_headers(...)`,
   * so dropping it removed a redundant weaker credential rather than a
   * capability.
   *
   * The assertion is inverted rather than deleted. A test that demands the
   * static path be present does not merely fail — it tells whoever is trying to
   * make the suite green to put a replayable secret back into an
   * unauthenticated edge function. That is the most expensive shape a stale
   * test can have, so this one now fails if the static path returns.
   *
   * It is not a new opinion, either: `send-web-push/security-contract.test.ts`
   * has held exactly this contract on the Deno side since WP-12 ("the static
   * cron-secret helper must no longer gate this function"). The two suites
   * simply disagreed, and the one that ran in CI's vitest job was the stale
   * one. `verifyRequiredCronSecret` remains correct for the fourteen functions
   * that still authenticate that way; this is about this receiver.
