/**
 * Builder stock — nothing in this surface may believe a `.limit()`.
 *
 * PostgREST does not honour the row count a caller asks for. It caps every
 * response at `db-max-rows`, which `supabase/config.toml` sets to 1,000 and
 * which was measured against production on 1 September 2026: a request for
 * 200,000 rows of an 18,519-row table answered `content-range: 0-999/18519`
 * with HTTP 200 and no error anywhere in the response body.
 *
 * The cost of learning that was the marketplace. `enforceStrictPrimaryImages`
 * read 1,000 of an organisation's 1,926 images and cleared the primary-image
 * pointer of every property whose photograph was in the other 926, because an
 * image that is not in the answer is indistinguishable from an image that does
 * not exist. Eleven properties holding an eligible builder photograph — every
 * one of them at physical position 1,125-1,781 — showed an empty card.
 *
 * So the rule is not "page the read that broke". It is that a `.limit()` above
 * the cap is a statement the API will ignore, and there is no way to tell from
 * the response that it did: the scan below fails on any of them.
