/**
 * Contract tests for the second notification defect — the one that kept the bell
 * empty even after every producer was repaired.
 *
 * The read path looked healthy from every angle except the only one that
 * mattered. Production evidence:
 *
 *   - The browser's request is in the API log and returns 200:
 *       GET /rest/v1/notifications?...&or=(target_user_id.is.null,target_user_id.eq.<uid>)
 *   - Replaying that exact query as `authenticated` with that user's claims
 *     returns 50 rows, all unread.
 *   - Replaying it as `anon` returns 0 rows AND NO ERROR.
 *
 * So the browser was querying as `anon`. `notifications` policies are all
 * `TO authenticated`, but `anon` still held a SELECT grant — and RLS is additive
 * over GRANTs, so Postgres matched no policy and PostgREST answered `200 []`
 * instead of refusing. The app has two credentials: the staff session cookie
 * (which every edge function uses, and which works) and a self-minted Supabase
 * JWT for direct PostgREST calls. `custom-auth-verify-v2` treats that JWT as
 * optional — on a signing failure it still answers `valid: true` with
 * `access_token: null` — and the client then builds a plain anon-key client.
 *
 * The table dates the regression precisely: of ~2,000 notifications written
 * since 3 July, not one has ever been marked read; on 1 July it was 65 of 65.
 * `markAsRead` under anon is a silent no-op.
 *
 * The fix is to stop depending on that JWT for the bell, and to make the
 * degraded state impossible to miss everywhere else.
