/**
 * Builder stock — the FOURTH question, and the one the card actually asks.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED IN PRODUCTION. Two Marketplace cards showed the property's
 * own facade under promotional pills — "Completed" and "SMSF" on Lot 13
 * Hummock Rise, "$25,000 Rebate", "VIC" and "LARA" on Lot 1663 Ringer Street.
 * The source audit proved every provenance claim behind them: the stored bytes
 * and the Notion attachment hash identically, the row designates that image and
 * no other, and no clean original exists anywhere in either property's chain.
 *
 * So provenance, ownership and role all answer YES and the card is still
 * wrong, which is why display eligibility is a fourth question with its own
 * answer stored beside the other three. The role stays `primary_property` —
 * that is what the source said, and falsifying it to hide the picture would
 * put a lie in the audit trail.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THESE PIN ABOVE ALL.
 *
 *   IT FAILS CLOSED. An image nothing could decode is `pending`, never
 *   `eligible`. "We could not look" and "we looked and it was clean" are
 *   different facts, and a container no decoder here reads must never be a way
 *   for a marketing tile to walk past the rule.
 *
 *   IT IS A PIPELINE RULE, NOT A REPAIR. Every future import of every
 *   supported format asks the same question of the same bytes at the same
 *   point, persists the same answer, and both selectors read it. No property,
 *   filename, word, colour, font or position is named anywhere in the
 *   implementation.
 *
 * The fixtures are drawn rather than sampled, and drawn to the geometry the
 * live tiles actually have: a flat block with straight sides, and lettering
 * set on a common baseline, over a photograph with grain in it.

/**
 * Builder Stock accepts WebP, so a clean WebP has to be able to reach a card.
 *
 * BOTH FIXTURES ARE GENERATED HERE, NOT CHECKED IN. No generated image may be
 * committed to this repository — the release gate refuses any `.png`, `.jpg` or
 * `.webp` in a change — so the bitstreams are written in memory by encoders
 * built from RFC 6386 and the WebP lossless specification, independently of the
 * decoders they feed. An encoder that shares its author's misreadings with the
 * decoder proves nothing; two written from the specification separately make
 * the round trip worth something.
 *
 * `vp8Encoder.ts` writes the lossy bitstream — the arithmetic coder, the frame
 * header, key-frame mode records, the forward transform and the token tree —
 * so the larger and riskier half of the decoder is exercised end to end rather
 * than left untested for want of a committed file.
