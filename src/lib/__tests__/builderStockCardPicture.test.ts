/**
 * Builder stock — how a photograph sits in a card, and the fact in its title.
 *
 * TWO DEFECTS, ONE MISTAKE. The card began as a 160px strip with
 * `object-cover`, which discarded 68% of a portrait render and kept a band of
 * sky — no house. The repair was to CONTAIN every picture in a 16:10 frame,
 * nothing cropped ever, and that bought the defect that replaced it: a grey
 * band above and below almost every card, reported as looking broken.
 *
 * Both treated the frame and the fit as one decision. MEASURED over the 94
 * properties live on 11 September 2026:
 *
 *     1.778   66 cards   the modal shape, by a factor of six
 *                        (64 exactly 16:9, 2 at 1.7780)
 *     1.600   11 cards
 *     1.258    7 cards
 *     1.400    3 cards
 *     1.019    3 cards
 *     1.416    2 cards
 *     1.717    2 cards
 *
 * The 16:10 frame had been fitted to a corpus of twenty-seven that a later
 * stock list replaced entirely — the lesson being that a frame fitted to one
 * upload is wrong for the next. 16:9 is not fitted: it is what the builders'
 * rendering software emits, and 70% of the live list matches it exactly.
 *
 * The fit then turns on WHICH WAY the crop would run. Taller than the frame
 * and covering takes sky and foreground planting; checked by eye against the
 * three worst live images, where a 43% crop removed nothing but sky and
 * shrubs. Wider than the frame and covering takes the sides, which is where a
 * house extends. Generous allowance one way, tight the other.
