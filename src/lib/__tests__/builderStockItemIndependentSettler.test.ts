/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — ONE PROPERTY'S FAILURE MUST COST ONE PROPERTY.
 *
 * PRODUCTION, 29 AUGUST 2026, seventeen minutes of the settler:
 *
 *     02:19:09  CPU Time exceeded      (claimed the lease, killed, no release)
 *     02:20:01  lease_held
 *     02:21:01  lease_held
 *     02:22:08  lease claim: canceling statement due to statement timeout
 *     02:23:07  CPU Time exceeded
 *     02:24:01  lease_held
 *     ...
 *
 * Six kills, ten skips, not one completed tick, no work at all. Upload
 * `d49ca895` had imported 23 properties twenty-six hours earlier; the walk had
 * reached item 13 and items 14 to 23 had never been read once.
 *
 * Two structures produced it. The imagery walk is ordered by `created_at` with
 * NO CURSOR and ends the whole run on the first cap it hits, so everything
 * behind the expensive property waits for ever. And the lease is ONE BOOLEAN
 * ROW for the whole deployment — a killed worker runs no `finally`, so it holds
 * that row until it expires and the queue is shut for everybody, not just for
 * the property that died.
 *
 * This file pins the replacement. It is ORCHESTRATION ONLY: source discovery,
 * the Drive rendition rule, web verification, the Street View distance guard,
 * image priority and the sanitizer are called exactly as they were and decide
 * exactly what they decided. What changes is WHICH property, WHEN, and what is
 * written down afterwards.

/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — AN EMPTY ITEM QUEUE IS WHEN THE UPLOAD MARKERS ARE OWED.
 *
 * PRODUCTION, 30 AUGUST - 1 SEPTEMBER 2026. Upload `a0f8dfe4` (`export.csv`,
 * 26 properties) settled every one of its items and then sat at
 * `status = 'enriching'` for thirty-six hours with all three upload markers
 * NULL — `source_images_settled_version`,
 * `marketplace_eligibility_settled_version`,
 * `image_sanitization_settled_version`.
 *
 * The per-item queue replaced the upload walk for finding and judging
 * pictures, but never took over stamping those markers: only
 * `settleUploadSourceImages` writes them, and it is reached only through the
 * sweep that sits BELOW the deployment-skew branch. With the claim function
 * deployed, that branch is unreachable — measured, 4,438 settler invocations
 * in twenty-four hours, every one an item tick, NOT ONE a settlement tick and
 * not one reporting skew.
 *
 * `builder_stock_uploads` therefore never stopped counting as outstanding, so
 * `settle_builder_stock_marketplace_eligibility_tick` could never satisfy its
 * own retirement condition and the cron fired once a minute for ever against
 * an empty queue.
