/**
 * Builder stock — the constrained generative repair, and the guarantees that
 * make it safe to put on a client's screen.
 *
 * The deterministic reconstruction handles a small badge on quiet ground. These
 * cover what happens when it refuses: the same mask, the same original bytes, a
 * model asked to rebuild only what was behind the graphic — and the arithmetic
 * that makes "everything outside the mask is the builder's own pixel" a fact
 * about the compositing rather than a hope about the model.
 *
 * THE MODEL IS A STUB HERE ON PURPOSE. What is worth pinning is not that an
 * endpoint returns a nice picture; it is that a HOSTILE answer — a whole new
 * image, a wrong size, a flat colour — cannot reach a card and cannot alter one
 * pixel of the photograph outside the badge. So one stub returns a plausible
 * reconstruction and another returns something completely different, and both
 * are asserted against the original bytes.
