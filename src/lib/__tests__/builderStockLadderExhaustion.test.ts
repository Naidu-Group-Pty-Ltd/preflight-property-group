/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — STAGE 1 ANSWERING "NO" IS NOT STAGE 1 FAILING TO ANSWER.
 *
 * PRODUCTION, 30 AUGUST 2026. Two properties on one estate reached the
 * Marketplace blank. Each had been through the whole of stage 1: its Notion
 * row's own cover was stored and measured, and its OWN linked package — a
 * different Drive folder per product — was opened twice, killed the worker
 * twice, and was retired at MAX_PACKAGE_ATTEMPTS with
 * `no_deterministic_image`. That much is the documented, deliberate behaviour,
 * and the code that does it promises the property "loses its builder image and
 * GAINS the fallback ladder".
 *
 * It did not gain the fallback ladder, for two independent reasons.
 *
 * ONE. `wait` HAD NO EXIT. A source image that had been measured, refused as a
 * marketing tile, and whose repair question was closed too still satisfied
 * "not displayable", which was the whole of the pending test. So the ladder
 * answered `wait` — evidence that has not arrived — on every pass, for ever.
 * `wait` writes nothing and advances nothing, so stage 2 and stage 3 were
 * unreachable however many times the property was claimed.
 *
 * TWO. A SKIP WAS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM AN EXHAUSTION. When stage 1 answers,
 * the two paid stages are recorded as skipped — "the builder supplied an image
 * for this property". Those rows were written under the same `stage-status`
 * reference as a stage that RAN and found nothing. Stage 1's answer then
 * changed: the cover was re-measured as a marketing tile eighteen hours later.
 * The skips survived, and every "is there a row for this stage?" test read
 * them as a ladder already climbed.
 *
 * Written on invented data. No estate, lot, anchor, organisation or file name
 * here belongs to any deployment.
