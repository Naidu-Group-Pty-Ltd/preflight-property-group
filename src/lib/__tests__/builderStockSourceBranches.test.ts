/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — A PROPERTY ROW MAY OWN SEVERAL BUILDER SOURCES.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, VERBATIM:
 *
 *     return links.size === 1 ? [...links][0] : null;
 *
 * "Two different package links on one row is a row that does not say which
 * package is its own, and the answer to that is no image." That is true of a
 * source whose rows carry at most one link, where a second really does mean
 * ambiguity. It is false of a spreadsheet, where a stock row legitimately
 * carries a brochure, a siting plan, an estate map, a plan of subdivision and
 * a rental appraisal — and the rule declined ALL FIVE. A property with five
 * builder documents was treated as a property with none, and stage 1 began at
 * its second rung.
 *
 * The correction is not a better choice between them. It is to stop choosing.
 *
 * NOTHING BELOW READS A COLUMN NAME, and the headings here are deliberately
 * nothing like any real spreadsheet's: the next builder will call the same
 * thing `Package`, `Downloads`, `Property Documents` or `Plans`, and a rule
 * keyed on any of those is one spreadsheet's structure compiled into the
 * product. The heading travels as provenance and decides nothing.
