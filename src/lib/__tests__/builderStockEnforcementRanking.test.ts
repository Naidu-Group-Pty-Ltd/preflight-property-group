/**
 * Builder stock — the org-wide enforcement sweep must rank the way everything
 * else ranks.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENED. `enforceStrictPrimaryImages` settles every property an
 * organisation holds, not only the ones a repair run touched. It ranked with
 * `chooseDisplayableImage` — the builder's own file or nothing — because that
 * was the product rule when it was written. `imagePriority.pure.ts` then
 * replaced that rule with a ladder that admits a web photograph VERIFIED to be
 * this property (tier 3) and Street View of this exact address (tier 4), and
 * `chooseAndStorePrimaryImage` moved onto `chooseCardImage`. The sweep did not.
 *
 * So the two writers disagreed, and whichever ran last won. The per-item path
 * sets a fallback pointer; the sweep deletes it as "nothing to show"; the next
 * repair sets it again. The pointers the sweep clears are exactly the ones the
 * current rule creates.
 *
 * MEASURED AGAINST PRODUCTION, 1 SEPTEMBER 2026, on the 430 live pointers:
 *
 *   156  google_maps / location_derived      cleared — wrong stage
 *     7  internet_search / identity verified  cleared — wrong stage
 *    25  uploaded_document, no stored role    cleared — role reads `unknown`
 *   ---
 *   188  of 430, 44% of the marketplace, blanked by one pass.
 *
 * None of the three is caught by the skip guard: `awaitingVerdict` returns
 * false at the same two gates, so an item it can never rescue is an item it
 * hands straight to the clear. It ran once and 45 pointers went.
 *
 * The rows below are the four shapes production actually holds, taken from
 * that measurement rather than invented.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WEAKENS THE DISPLAY RULE. An unjudged builder image is still
 * hidden, an unverified search hit is still refused, and a satellite tile is
 * still not a photograph — those are `imagePriority.pure.ts`'s tests, and this
 * file asserts only that the sweep asks it rather than answering by itself.

 * not read as unloaded; they read as ABSENT — so every property whose
 * photograph sat past the cut reached `chooseCardImage([])` and had its pointer
 * CLEARED. All eleven properties holding an eligible builder photograph had it
 * at physical position 1,125-1,781, and all eleven were blank. Live pointers
