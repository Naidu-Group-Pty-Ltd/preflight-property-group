/**
 * Builder stock — the residue a repair can leave, and the questions the gates
 * now ask about it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PINS, AND WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. A visual census of every
 * served derivative found nine of seventeen rows carrying residue the
 * platform's own instruments measure as nothing: a white plate the neutral
 * floor cannot see, a pale strip below the faint pass's size floors, a corner
 * wedge where a removed pill met the frame. Some of that is structurally
 * below measured thresholds and stays a documented `repair_region` case — but
 * two parts of it were GATES READING ANSWERS NOBODY ASKED FOR, and those are
 * fixed and pinned here:
 *
 *   the post-repair check read a faint-text count that `readMarketingOverlay`
 *   structurally suppresses whenever a flat region survives — so every
 *   derivative served over a surviving flat region had, by construction,
 *   never been asked the faint question;
 *
 *   and nothing after a repair looked for a brand-coloured plate AWAY from
 *   the repaired area, which a supplied `repair_region` makes reachable: the
 *   operator's rectangle replaces the derived mask entirely.
 *
 * The rest of the file pins the detector's documented exemptions AS
 * exemptions — a diagonal ribbon, a price roundel, a full-bleed band, a
 * neutral plate below the floor — so each stays a decision with a fixture
 * rather than an accident nobody can name, and pins the mask-growth geometry
 * at production scale, which no test exercised.
