/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS FOUND AND THEN THROWN AWAY.
 *
 * LIVE MARKETPLACE, 28 AUGUST 2026, upload 4dfe1be7.
 *
 * LOT 13 HUMMOCK RISE showed a Street View of the road. #2334 had worked: the
 * settler logged, verbatim,
 *
 *   reference: "Display Home - 13 Hummock Rise Werribee/Property Photos/Kaye_7341_HR.jpg"
 *   reason:    "The recovered photograph could not be stored."
 *
 * The traversal, the street-address identity and the photograph selection were
 * all correct. The file was downloaded — a valid JPEG, `ff d8 ff e1`, HTTP 200,
 * `image/jpeg` — and `validateSourceImageBytes` refused it at 12.28 MB against
 * a 10 MB `MAX_SOURCE_IMAGE_BYTES`. No row was written, `source_provenance_result`
 * stayed NULL, and the card fell through to Stage 3.
 *
 * Trying the next photograph is no answer: the first ten of that folder's 38
 * measure 12.28, 14.55, 14.01, 13.77, 14.70, 14.45, 16.28, 15.99, 13.84 and
 * 13.25 MB. Every one is over. The builder photographed the house at full
 * resolution, which is the right thing for a builder to do.
 *
 * LOT 1663 RINGER STREET showed a roundabout. Its package WAS selected — the
 * same run logged "package retired after 2 resource-limit failures" against
 * folder 1Y7UPKiG… — so Stage 3 answered, and Stage 3 had no usefulness test of
 * any kind: `enrichFromGoogle` asked Google for the nearest panorama to a
 * geocode and accepted whatever came back, at any distance. On a new estate
 * whose own street has never been driven, the nearest panorama is the arterial
 * road it joins.
