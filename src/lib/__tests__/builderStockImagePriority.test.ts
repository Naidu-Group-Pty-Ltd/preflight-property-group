/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — SOURCE, THEN A VERIFIED WEB PHOTOGRAPH, THEN STREET VIEW.
 *
 * The old rule was "the builder's own image, or nothing", and it was right
 * while the only alternatives were an unverified search hit and a satellite
 * tile. Its cost was a marketplace of empty frames. The rule is now a ranking,
 * and everything worth pinning about it is a way the ranking could go wrong:
 *
 *   A FALLBACK NEVER OUTRANKS A SOURCE, including one that arrives later.
 *   FINDING A URL IS NOT VERIFYING A PROPERTY — and 439 production rows say
 *     `unverified`, so none of them may become displayable retroactively.
 *   STREET VIEW MEANS STREET VIEW; a satellite tile is a roof.
 *   NOTHING BUT THE BUILDER'S OWN FILE IS EVER "Builder supplied".
