/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — A REPLACEMENT LIST MUST NOT BLANK A WORKING MARKETPLACE.
 *
 * WHAT #2347 LEFT. That change made a re-import find the property it already
 * imported — same `source_anchor`, same exact-property identity, update in
 * place, imagery survives. It fixes MATCHED properties completely, and it was
 * said at the time that it fixes nothing else.
 *
 * A genuinely NEW or UNMATCHED row is still inserted `lifecycle_status =
 * 'active'` inside the import request, before one pixel of its imagery has
 * been looked for. The Marketplace's only visibility gate is
 * `.eq('lifecycle_status','active')`, so that row reaches a client's screen
 * immediately as a card reading "No image found", and stays that way for as
 * long as its source work takes. A replacement list of twenty-three new
 * properties turns a working Marketplace into twenty-three blank cards the
 * instant it is imported.
 *
 * THE MODEL IS ONE EXTRA LIFECYCLE VALUE. Every consumer of `lifecycle_status`
 * already filters POSITIVELY on `'active'`, so a third value is invisible
 * everywhere by construction — nothing has to learn to hide it. The half that
 * is easy to miss is the other side: PROCESSING has to widen, or a staged row
 * can never reach readiness and would sit invisible for ever.
 *
 *     SERVING     stays  = 'active'
 *     PROCESSING becomes IN ('active','staged')
 *
 * The migration's behaviour was verified against the live database inside a
 * rolled-back transaction: staged rows invisible (2 staged, 0 active),
 * publication refused while one row still owed source work
 * (`source_outstanding: 1`), the published set untouched by that refusal (23
 * active), then published (promoted 2), the replaced upload's remaining rows
 * archived (0 still active), the new dataset served, `published_at` stamped.
