/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — ONE HEAVY PACKAGE MUST NOT PIN AN ENTIRE UPLOAD.
 *
 * PRODUCTION, 28 AUGUST 2026. Upload `eccc9840` settled twelve properties and
 * then stopped dead on the thirteenth — Lot 104, Finch Road, Century Estate,
 * package folder `1K8Pl5x…`. Every tick from 02:00 onward did the same thing:
 *
 *   02:00:02 booted → 02:00:11  CPU Time exceeded / shutdown
 *   02:05:01 booted → 02:05:07  CPU Time exceeded / shutdown
 *   02:15:01 booted → 02:15:08  CPU Time exceeded / shutdown
 *   02:20:01 booted → 02:20:07  Memory limit exceeded / shutdown
 *
 * No tick log was ever emitted, because the log line comes after the work. The
 * upload's `source_images_settled_version` stayed NULL, so it never settled, so
 * the fallback ladder was never entered, so Lot 13, Lot 1663 and Lot 3 Yamanto
 * stayed blank on the live Marketplace. Twenty-three properties held still by
 * one document.
 *
 * WHY NOTHING ALREADY CAUGHT IT. `recoverPackageImage` is uninterruptible and a
 * worker kill raises nothing — no throw to catch, no `finally`, no response.
 * `MAX_ITEMS_RESTORED_PER_RUN` and `MAX_PACKAGE_RECOVERIES_PER_RUN` are
 * per-run counters that reset. `PACKAGE_RECOVERY_RESERVE_MS` reserves wall
 * clock, and the binding limit is CPU and memory. So every guard was blind and
 * the next tick restarted the identical work.
 *
 * These tests pin the property that fixes it: an attempt is durable, so being
 * killed is evidence, and evidence lets the sweep advance.

 * `recordPackageAttempt` always stamps a fresh `started_at` and only the undo
 * path rewrites a record it did not author. Four ticks (05:40, 05:45, 05:50,

 * were never touched at all: `updated_at` still 02:53:19, import time.
