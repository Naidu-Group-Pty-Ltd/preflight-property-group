/**
 * A label is a promise that a figure follows it — the Investment Compass half.
 *
 * `liveCashFlowLabels.spec.ts` is the same rule on the 10 Year Cash Flow. This
 * one covers the two defects a render of the stored report `1be16c4a`
 * (93 Bimbadeen Avenue, Banora Point, 15 Aug 2026) showed on the page:
 *
 *  - the property table printed **eight labels and one value**. Six of its rows
 *    were ruled, striped and empty. That is not one unlucky record: counted
 *    over the whole `investment_reports` table on 2026-08-16, `year_built`,
 *    `zoning` and `council_area` are null on **every one of the 1,187 rows**,
 *    and land and building size are null on every one of them too;
 *  - and the two dimensions a reader of a property report looks for first were
 *    *in the record all along*, one column over under different names —
 *    `financial_calculations.propertySpecs.landSizeSqm` and `buildSizeSqm`, on
 *    114 rows each. `projectInvestmentReport` read only `property_specs`, so
 *    `property.landArea` could not resolve on any report ever generated.
 *
 * The tests render the real masters against the real stored shape, because the
 * fixture is what hid this: `SAMPLE_REPORT_DATA` fills every one of these
 * fields, so a check against it passes while production prints blank rows.

 * The cover title, which has no fixed number of lines.

 * at p90, 61 at p99 and **84** at its longest. The title reserved two lines at
 * the family's display size, which is 41pt on Private Banking and 61pt on
 * Objective — so a long address set three, four or six lines and printed
 * through the gold rule and across the standfirst beneath it.
 *
 * Two things fix it, and this pins both because neither is visible from a
 * render of the median address:
 *
 *  - the block is anchored at its FOOT, so it grows up into the empty half of
 *    the cover instead of down into the standfirst;
 *  - and where a family's display size cannot carry 84 characters in the space
 *    between the rule and the head, the master carries a second, smaller title
 *    under a complementary conditional. Four of the fifty need one.
 *
