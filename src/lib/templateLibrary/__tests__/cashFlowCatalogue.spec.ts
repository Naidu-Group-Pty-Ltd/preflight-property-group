/**
 * The 10 Year Cash Flow family catalogue — the fifth report format drawn in the
 * ten Investment Compass designs.
 *
 * Four things here are specific to this format:
 *
 *  1. **No total row anywhere.** The record carries two totals that do not
 *     equal the figures beside them — `initialCosts.totalUpfront` on 132 of
 *     161 rows, `annualCosts.totalAnnual` on 141 of 162 — so the projection
 *     does not publish them and these masters cannot bind them. The instinct
 *     when laying out a cost table is to add a total row, which is exactly why
 *     this is asserted rather than left to the comment in the source.
 *  2. **No client and no adviser.** `investment_reports` has no client-name
 *     column. A binding that cannot resolve renders as the empty string, not as
 *     a visible `{{…}}`, so a cover titled `{{client.name}}` ships blank — which
 *     is what the Borrowing Capacity and Comparison masters did until this
 *     format's audit found it.
 *  3. **Ten-row tables on a page model that cannot paginate**, on ten spacing
 *     scales that put the same ten rows anywhere between 154pt and 244pt.
 *  4. **The chart plots equity**, because equity is positive on all 4,860
 *     stored elements and cash flow is negative on 4,856 of them.
