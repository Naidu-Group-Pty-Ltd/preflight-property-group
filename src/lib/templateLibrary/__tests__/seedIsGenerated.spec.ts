/**
 * The seeded catalogue is generated, and something has to say so out loud.
 *
 * `buildSeedCatalogue.ts` writes a 40 MB migration from the template
 * definitions, and until 22 September 2026 **nothing compared the two**. The
 * generator could be run or not run and the repository looked identical either
 * way — so seed v19 was written, four commits changed what the definitions
 * produce, and the migration still carried the old geometry for 301 of its 543
 * templates. The migration is what a deployment applies, so a fix that reaches
 * only the definitions reaches no document at all.
 *
 * `npm run templates:library:seed:check` is the comparison. This file asserts
 * that the comparison EXISTS and that CI runs it, which is the rule
 * `builderPortalUiMounted.spec.ts` was written for: a check nothing invokes is
 * dead code that typechecks, lints and ships.
 *
 * It deliberately does not run the generator — that is a minute of work and
 * 40 MB of output, and it is the CI step's job. What is asserted here is the
 * wiring, because the wiring is what went missing.
