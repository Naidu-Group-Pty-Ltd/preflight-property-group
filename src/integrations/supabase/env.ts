/**
 * The one place that decides which Supabase project this build talks to.
 *
 * Both the URL and the publishable ("anon") key used to be written into 31
 * source files by hand. That is why this repository could not be pointed at
 * its own backend: changing `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` moved nothing, because almost
 * every caller ignored it and dialled the prime's project directly.
 *
 * ── The pairing rule ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The anon key is a JWT whose `ref` claim names the project it belongs to, so
 * a URL from one project and a key from another authenticate to nothing. They
 * are therefore resolved as a PAIR: either the environment supplies both, or
 * neither is taken from it. A half-configured environment falls back to the
 * built-in pair and says so loudly, because silently mixing them produces
 * 401s that look like an auth bug rather than a configuration one.
 *
 * ── The fallback is this deployment's own pair ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A build with no Supabase variables set — a repository checkout, a CI run, a
 * deployment nobody has configured yet — resolves to the built-in pair, and
 * that pair lives in `supabaseTarget.pure.ts`: the one file here that differs
 * between deployments, and one the cascade never writes. On the prime it names
 * the prime; on a clone, Mission Control's provisioning rewrites it to the
 * clone's own project. Only a build that sets the variables moves. This file
 * holds no per-deployment value at all, which is what lets the prime's copy
 * and a clone's be the same file.
 *
 * ── The read is STATIC, and that is the whole of it ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Every name below is read as the literal expression `import.meta.env.VITE_X`.
 * Vite replaces that exact token sequence with the value at BUILD time. Put
 * anything between `import.meta` and `.env` — an optional chain, a bracket
 * index — and the sequence no longer matches, nothing is replaced, and the
 * read is a property access on a browser's real `import.meta`, which has no
 * `env`. It returns `undefined` forever, however the environment is set.
 *
 * This module used to read through `readEnv(key)` — `import.meta?.env?.[key]`
 * — and it cost every clone its own backend. Measured 19 Sep 2026 on
 * `npc-crm-independent`: Mission Control provisioned the clone its own
 * Supabase project, wrote the admin's password into it, published all five
 * `VITE_*` variables to the hosting project and rebuilt — and the deployed
 * bundle carried neither the URL nor the key. The browser resolved to the
 * fallback and authenticated against the PRIME, where that password does not
 * exist, so the reported symptom was "I cannot log in to the new clone with
 * the credentials Mission Control issued". Loading the live page in a real
 * Chromium showed it opening a realtime socket to the prime's project with
 * the prime's anon key. `preflight-property-group` does the same thing, so
 * this was true of every clone ever provisioned.
 *
 * This file names no project, in code or in prose. Every deployment carries
 * it byte for byte; the one value that differs lives next door.
 *
 * Two things made it invisible. The fallback was the PRIME's own pair on every
 * clone, so the one deployment anybody tests on — the prime — was correct by
 * accident. And `resolveSupabaseTarget` warns on a HALF-configured environment
 * and says nothing when neither value arrives, because that is the ordinary
 * state of an unconfigured build; a clone whose variables were dropped looks
 * exactly like one.
 * Nothing in the browser can tell those apart, which is why the guarantee that
 * a clone's build carries its OWN project belongs to the provisioner, asserted
 * against the deployed bundle rather than against the variables it set.
 *
 * `turnstileSiteKey.ts` fixed this same defect for its own variable and cites
 * THIS module as the precedent for the pairing rule. It was right about the
 * rule and wrong about the read; the read is fixed here now, and
 * `buildTimeEnvReads.spec.ts` fails on any form a bundler cannot see through.
 *
 * One consequence worth naming: while this was broken `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`
 * resolved to the prime on every clone, so `turnstileSiteKey`'s pairing rule
 * — "the built-in widget is used only while the build talks to the project its
 * secret lives in" — was being fed a lie and handed each clone the PRIME's
 * widget. The rule was intact; its input was not.
