/**
 * The ten-stage AML/CTF journey rail — the workspace's primary navigation.
 *
 * ── What clicking a stage does, and does not do ────────────────────────
 * It navigates. That is all. Selecting a stage — or reaching the last one
 * — changes no case stage, no risk rating, no verification outcome, no
 * screening result, no decision, no service gate, no Passport version and
 * no partner access. Every mark on this rail is read from evidence by
 * `deriveAmlJourney`, so a stage cannot be "completed" by walking to it.
 *
 * ── Status is never colour alone ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Each step carries a glyph (a tick, a number, a caution mark), a visible
 * label, and a screen-reader status sentence. `aria-current="step"` marks
 * the open stage. The rail is an ordered list inside a landmark, so
 * assistive technology reads it as the sequence it is.
