/**
 * The control that hands someone a typeset Report Q&A document.
 *
 * ## Three subjects, because the feature has three documents
 *
 * The Q&A export is four PDF implementations across three libraries, and they
 * do not produce the same thing: a structured write-up of the conversation, one
 * answer, and the transcript. This offers all three from one place and renders
 * all three with one renderer — which is the migration, since the reason the
 * same table-rendering bug got fixed in one jsPDF copy and not the other two is
 * that there were three of them.
 *
 * ## It sits beside the legacy, not in place of it
 *
 * `ConversationReportEditor`, `MessageReportEditor` and the `generate-qa-pdf`
 * action all keep working, as do the `.txt` / `.csv` / `.md` / `.json` exports —
 * the last of which is what this document's own truncation notice points at.
 * Where the route is not deployed yet this says so and names the ones that work.
 *
 * ## Two destinations
 *
 * Saved, and — for the whole-conversation subjects — posted into the
 * conversation as an attachment, which is what makes it reachable by the
 * in-place email composer. `deliverReportQaPdf` returns the `Blob` for the first
 * and the route writes the attachment row for the second.
