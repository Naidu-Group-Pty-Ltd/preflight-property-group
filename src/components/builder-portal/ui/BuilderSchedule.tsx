/**
 * FIGURES SET AS A SCHEDULE, NOT AS A GRID OF TILES.
 *
 * What replaces the `BuilderPortalStatCard` grids. Nine bordered boxes each
 * holding a single digit — plus nine icon chips and nine shadows — took more
 * height than the content under them and gave "Active projects" exactly the
 * same weight as "Unread notifications". One ruled block costs four cells
 * instead of four borders, and lets the figure itself be the loud thing.
 *
 * ## Every figure carries a baseline, and the type enforces it
 *
 * `baseline` is REQUIRED. A bare `0` reads as a broken page; `0` above
 * "Nothing waiting on you" reads as finished. The dashboard used to paper over
 * this with a footnote under the whole grid — "a zero means nothing you can
 * see, not necessarily nothing at all" — which is an apology for a number that
 * does not explain itself. Making the field mandatory means a caller cannot
 * add a figure without saying what to read it against.
 *
 * A unit is optional because some figures are already denominated ($742k), but
 * a bare count should carry one.
 *
 * Display only: it renders what it is handed. It does not fetch, count, derive
 * or interpret, and what a zero means is the caller's copy to write.
