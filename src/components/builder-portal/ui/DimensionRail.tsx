/**
 * A LOT'S POSITION, DRAWN AS A DIMENSION LINE.
 *
 * The Builder portal's signature component, and the reason the redesign
 * exists. Construction is an ordered sequence — land registers, a slab goes
 * down, a frame goes up, lock-up, fixing, handover — and a builder reads a
 * dimension line without thinking: extension lines, tick terminators, and an
 * annotated extent between two stations.
 *
 * That is exactly the shape of the question this answers: *where is this lot,
 * and how long has it been there.* A progress bar can carry the first half and
 * throws the second away; a dimension line is built to carry both.
 *
 * ## Four rules
 *
 * **IT NEVER GUESSES A POSITION.** `currentIndex` is nullable on purpose. A
 * record that does not say which stage a lot is at draws the whole extent in
 * the pending weight and says so in the note — it does not default to the
 * first station, which would state a fact the data does not hold. An
 * out-of-range index is treated as absent rather than clamped, because a clamp
 * invents a position too.
 *
 * **IDENTITY IS THE LABEL, NEVER THE COLOUR.** Every station is named under
 * its own tick. Line weight and fill mark *progress*, so the rail stays
 * readable in greyscale, under any colour vision, and for a tenant whose
 * white-label primary lands anywhere on the wheel.
 *
 * **THE LINE WORK SCALES; THE TYPE DOES NOT.** This was an SVG first, inside a
 * 620-unit viewBox, and a viewBox scales its contents — so on a wide sheet the
 * drawing rendered at 2.8× and the station labels came out at 22px, swamping
 * the line they annotate. Laid out in HTML, each station takes a percentage
 * along the track while its label keeps a real CSS size at every width.
 *
 * **IT DRAWS; IT DOES NOT DECIDE.** No stage is derived here, no duration
 * computed, no ordering inferred. What a stage means, and whether a lot is
 * late, is the caller's to say.
