/**
 * Property-type glyphs for the listings map pins.
 *
 * Each glyph is a *single* path on a 24×24 grid, filled with `evenodd` so the
 * cut-outs (windows, doorways, the ring's centre) come from the same subpaths.
 * Two constraints drove that shape:
 *
 * - Markers are built as raw `divIcon` HTML, one copy per visible pin, so the
 *   markup has to stay small and has to be a string rather than a React tree.
 * - Glyphs render at 10–12px inside a pin head. A stroked lucide icon at that
 *   size scales its 2px stroke down to roughly one device pixel and vanishes
 *   against a coloured pin, so these are solid silhouettes instead.
 *
 * Colour comes from the caller: nothing here names a fill, so the pins keep
 * inheriting the tier tokens and re-theme with the white-label brand.
