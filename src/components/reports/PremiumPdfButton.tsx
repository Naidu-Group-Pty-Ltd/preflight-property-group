/**
 * The one control that produces the client's Investment PDF.
 *
 * ## Why there is only one
 *
 * There used to be two, side by side: this, and a separately mounted browser
 * generator labelled "Download (legacy layout)". They took DIFFERENT switches
 * — this one carried Charts, Hero images and Sparklines, that one carried
 * Sources and Scoring — so which of the five a client's document honoured
 * depended on which button had been pressed, and neither honoured all five.
 * Two buttons meant two documents, which meant two truths.
 *
 * `produceInvestmentDocument` is the one contract now: it reads the record
 * once, applies the client-readiness gate, applies the content rules, and then
 * chooses a presentation — the template the person selected, or the standard
 * one. Every surface asks it, so a client receives the document the operator
 * reviewed whichever control they reached for.
