/**
 * Where the AML/CTF Compliance entry sits in a portal's sidebar.
 *
 * ── The reported problem ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "The AML/CTF Compliance tab on the left hand side is located at the bottom
 * of the list; this needs to be allocated at the top of the list under
 * Dashboard."
 *
 * That is not a matter of taste. A partner arrives at this page from an
 * email about a live purchase, reads the customer's completed due diligence,
 * and then has to find it again a week later without the email. At the foot
 * of a twelve-entry sidebar — below Earnings, below Reports & KPIs — it read
 * as an appendix. It is the record a settlement now depends on.
 *
 * ── What is pinned ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * POSITION, not the whole list. Every portal keeps its own ordering for
 * everything else; the one rule is that the Dashboard is first and the
 * compliance entry is immediately under it. Asserting the full array would
 * make this test about navigation in general and it would be rewritten,
 * rather than consulted, the next time an entry is added.
 *
 * The Client Portal is included and is deliberately DIFFERENT in one way:
 * its entry is called "Identity & Compliance", because that portal's reader
 * is the customer proving who they are, not a partner relying on somebody
 * else's diligence. Regulator vocabulary on a customer surface is a separate
 * defect, and moving a tab is not the moment to introduce it.
