/**
 * Navigation used to be four hand-synchronised lists (desktop sidebar,
 * mobile sidebar, bottom bar, command palette), and the admin group was a
 * second layer of drift: an item could be fully defined and still never
 * render because its title was missing from a separate `itemTitles` list.
 * That silent-gap bug shipped twice.
 *
 * The registry refactor removed the failure mode structurally — items carry
 * their own group, there is no title lookup, and every surface renders from
 * `src/lib/navigation/registry.ts` through the one visibility rule in
 * `useNavigationVisibility`. What this suite pins now is that the structure
 * STAYS that way: no surface may reintroduce a private navigation list, and
 * the registry itself must stay internally coherent.
 *
 * Read as source text rather than imported where the assertion is about the
 * file's shape, matching the repo's contract-test convention.
