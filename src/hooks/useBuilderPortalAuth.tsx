   *
   * The server was not the leak: every builder-portal query narrows to the
   * session's organisation, the accessible set comes from a SECURITY DEFINER
   * function scoped to the user, all four stock tables are RLS service-role
   * only and both buckets are private. The leak is HERE. React Query caches
   * one builder's data under keys that name no builder —
   * `['builder','stock','uploads',1]` — and `signOut` cleared this hook's
   * React state and nothing else. So:
   *
   *   sign in as Kopi Jantan   → cache fills under that key
   *   sign out                 → cache untouched
   *   sign in as Bob           → the page mounts, reads the SAME key, and
   *                              renders Kopi Jantan's stock lists
   *
   * before the refetch replaces them. One builder's commercial data drawn in
   * another builder's portal.
   *
   * It is fixed at the identity rather than at the key because
   * `builderKeys` has forty-odd entries — projects, units, transactions,
   * construction, documents, conversations — and every one of them is
   * organisation-blind in exactly the same way. Purging on the identity covers
   * all of them, and covers every key anybody adds later, which keying them
   * one by one would not.

   * account's credential on `credentials: 'include'` while still rendering the
   * old organisation's name, stock and chrome — because `checkSession` ran
   * only on mount, and nothing here listened for anything.
   *
   * The purge above fixes "sign out, sign in as somebody else, same tab". It
   * cannot see "two tabs, one cookie", because the stale tab never asks again.
   *
   * So it asks again: on a message from another tab (BroadcastChannel
   * delivers only to OTHER contexts, which is exactly the case that was
   * blind), and when this tab is focused or made visible — the moment before
