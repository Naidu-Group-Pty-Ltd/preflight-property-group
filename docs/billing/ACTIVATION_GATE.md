# The activation gate

A clone provisioned onto a **paid plan** boots with a clock on it. It works
normally until the window closes — 72 hours by default — and is then locked
behind a payment screen until Stripe captures the activation payment for
Aurixa Systems, at which point it opens by itself.

**The prime and every clone that already exists are not gated, and cannot
become gated.** That is the property everything below is arranged to protect.

---

## The three-sentence version

1. Mission Control writes one `clone_payment_gates` row when it provisions a
   paid clone, and nothing else ever writes one.
2. The gate's status is **derived on every read** from four stored facts —
   the operator's override, whether Stripe paid, when the window closes, and
   the time — by one module, `clonePaymentGate.pure.ts`.
3. This workspace asks Mission Control for that status through
   `mission-control-gate` and renders it. It never decides one.

---

## Why the status is not stored

The obvious design is a `status` column that a worker flips to `locked` when
the deadline passes. It is rejected, and the reason is in this platform's own
history.

Mission Control's own `THE_CLONING_ENGINE.md` records six pg_cron jobs
that were **never scheduled at all** — silently, for months. A migration read
an empty vault, raised a NOTICE nobody reads, and returned; the job was never
created; and a job that does not exist has no failing run to report. Two of the
three clone-provisioning engines had never run and every check said the system
was healthy.

A gate whose *closing* depends on a worker fails **open** under exactly that
fault, and nothing anywhere reports it. So nothing closes a gate here. There is
no worker in this feature's critical path at all, and the table has no `status`
column to store one in — asserted by a test, because a column somebody adds
later is how the design quietly reverts.

## Why a locked answer is the only thing that locks

The clone fails **open** on everything: no Mission Control credentials, an
unreachable Mission Control, a timeout, a 500, a body that will not parse, a
`reason` word this build has never heard of, a payload whose convenience
`locked: true` disagrees with its decided `status: "open"`. All of them render
the dashboard.

That is not laxity — it is where the enforcement actually lives:

| Layer | What it does | Fails how |
| ----- | ------------ | --------- |
| Mission Control `tokens/reserve`, `seats/reserve` | Refuses a locked clone with **402 `workspace_locked`** | Open, on a DB read error only |
| This workspace's dashboard shell | Renders the payment screen instead of the app | Open, always |

The money boundary is the one that matters. A clone provisioned by Mission
Control runs on the **prime's forwarded vendor keys** (see
`docs/integrations/API_USAGE_METERING.md`), so an unpaid workspace generating
reports spends Aurixa's own OpenAI and property-data budget — and a browser
lock screen does not stop a scripted caller. Mission Control's 402 does, and it
cannot be talked past.

What the browser screen *can* do that the server cannot is lock a **paying**
customer out over a network blip. That is the failure worth designing against,
and it is why every error path here is open.

## Why nothing is backfilled

A row IS the gate. No row means no gate, forever, and:

- `armGate` is called from exactly two places — `provisionClone`, and an
  explicit operator button for a paid clone that was somehow missed. A test
  enumerates the callers.
- No migration inserts into the table or derives rows from `clones`. A test
  asserts that too, because a backfill added later would lock the whole fleet
  on deploy with nobody watching.
- `gateEligibility` refuses to arm on an **unresolved** plan price. Gating a
  workspace that may owe nothing is an outage for somebody who did nothing
  wrong; leaving one ungated is a row the Payment Gates console lists as a gap
  for an operator to arm by hand. The visible failure is the safer one.

## What the operator can do

Mission Control → **Billing → Payment Gates**, and a card on each clone's own
page. Both render the same server-derived state through the same pure module,
so they cannot disagree.

- **Set the platform default** window, and a master switch that stops *arming*
  new gates. It deliberately does not unlock existing ones — a flag that
  silently unlocked a fleet on being toggled would be a much larger act than
  the word "enabled" suggests, so the panel says which one it is.
- **Set a custom window per clone**, measured from when the clone was created
  rather than from now, so extending "72 hours" means what the customer was
  told. Restarting the clock from now is a separate, explicit switch.
- **Lock and unlock by hand.** One column, `manual_override`, holds
  `'locked' | 'unlocked' | null`, so the two cannot both be set and no
  resolution order has to be invented. An unlock outranks the clock *and*
  non-payment; a lock outranks payment, which is how a workspace is suspended
  after it has paid.
- **Record a payment that arrived outside Stripe** — a bank transfer, an
  invoice settled by hand. It writes the same `paid_at` stamp Stripe writes, so
  the unlock is the same act and not a second kind of open, and it is
  attributed to `operator` so the ledger never claims Stripe captured money it
  did not.

Every one of these demands a reason of at least five characters, enforced in
the dialog **and** on the server, and every one appends to
`clone_payment_gate_events` with the status either side of it.

## What Stripe does

`checkout.session.completed` settles the gate at **one** place in the webhook —
after `isPaidSession` and after the purchase is finalised, i.e. exactly where
the platform has already concluded the money landed. Two call sites (one per
fulfilment branch) is how one of them comes to settle on a payment status the
other rejects.

Two more routes exist because money can arrive without a session:
`customer.subscription.*` going active (a subscription created in Stripe's own
dashboard never sees a checkout session) and `invoice.paid` (a renewal invoice
Stripe mints on its own cycle). `settleGatePayment` is idempotent on
`paid_at IS NULL`, so all three settling the same gate credits it once.

**A credit top-up does not activate a workspace.** `GATE_OPENING_MODES` is
`seat_plan` and `setup_package`; a $50 pack must not open a $2,015/month plan,
and the CTA a customer is shown leads to their plan, not to credits.

**A refund records and warns but never re-locks.** `charge.refunded` fires for
a partial refund too, so auto-locking would take a live workspace down over a
goodwill credit. It writes a `payment_reversed` event and an operator
notification that says the workspace is still open; the manual lock is the
deliberate act it leaves to a person.

## The CTA

One primary button. `POST /api/public/clones/gate/checkout` resolves the plan,
the price and the tenant from the gate row Mission Control already wrote and
returns a Stripe Checkout URL, so the button charges exactly what the clone was
armed for and the browser is never told a price it could edit. It refuses on a
gate that is already paid — a CTA is the one place that is easy to click twice.

The screen never dead-ends. If minting fails, the fallback is the pricing page
carrying this workspace's billing uid, which is always present in the gate
response for that reason. Returning from Stripe with `?activation=success`
re-reads the verdict every three seconds for half a minute, so a webhook that
lands a beat after the redirect opens the screen by itself rather than leaving
somebody looking at a wall they have just paid to remove.

Copy is about the **account**, never the reader: the person looking at it may
have joined last week and have no idea a payment was owed. It never says a
payment failed — this build cannot know that — and a test asserts the wording.
