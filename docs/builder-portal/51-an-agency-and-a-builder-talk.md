# 51 · An agency and a builder talk about an activated property

Command Centre users and a property's builder exchange messages about a property the Command Centre has activated. The messages travel over the signed Builders Network: no email, no separate API, no model.

The same contract is implemented twice:

- **Command Centre:** `20261221120000_an_agency_and_a_builder_talk_over_the_network.sql`.
- **aurixa-builders:** `20260925180000_an_agency_and_a_builder_talk_over_the_network.sql`, documented there as `docs/builder-portal/61-…`.

## 1. The conversation

**Key.** There is one conversation per (connection, property). Its id is derived, not stored in either system first:

```
md5('agency.conversation:' || <network connection id> || ':' || <stock item id>)::uuid
```

- Both ends compute the same id, so repeated "start" attempts converge.
- A payload naming any other id for that pair is refused as `conversation_mismatch`, so a message cannot be moved into another thread by changing an id.

**When it is open.** It is open while the property is activated:
- on the Command Centre: a live `builder_stock_selections` row;
- on the network: a live announcement on that connection.

When the activation is withdrawn, the history stays readable and nothing new can be written. The same holds when the builder stops listing the property: a property this deployment ever activated keeps its page and its conversation readable, while sending and activating still need active stock.

**Owner.** The Command Centre user whose activation opened it owns it (`owner_user_id`). Anyone with Listings edit access writes into it as themselves. On the network side, anyone in the builder's organisation with `inventory` edit writes as themselves. Every message carries its writer's display name.

## 2. The events

Both event types are sent through the existing outbox, signed, with the existing dedupe keys.

**`agency.message.posted`**
- dedupe key: `agency.message:<message id>:<generation>`
- payload keys, exactly: `schema_version` (1), `conversation_id`, `message_id`, `stock_item_id`, `body` (1–4,000 characters), `sender_display_name`, `sent_at` (the writing side's server clock), `generation`.
- It carries no user id, no client, no note and no email.

**`agency.message.receipt`**
- dedupe key: `agency.receipt:<message id>:<generation>`
- payload: `schema_version`, `message_id`, `conversation_id`, `generation`, `outcome` (`accepted` | `refused`), and `reason` when refused.

## 3. Delivery states

| State | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `queued` | Written here, not yet accepted by the other side. The door's 200 alone does not change this. |
| `delivered` | The other side's sweep applied the message and sent back an accepted receipt for this generation. |
| `failed` | Refused (with the other side's reason), the outbox row dead-lettered (`not_delivered`), or the current generation reached the other side and no receipt came back within 15 minutes (`confirmation_timeout`, shown as "Not confirmed" — never as a refusal, because the other side may hold it). |

**Retries.** A failed message stays visible. Only its writer can retry it, and only while the conversation is open. A retry re-sends it under generation + 1. The receiver answers every generation but stores the message once: rows are keyed by the sender's message id. So a message that WAS accepted, whose receipt was lost on the way back, is confirmed by the next generation's receipt. A late receipt for an older generation changes nothing.

**The confirmation window.** Without it, a lost receipt would leave a message Sending for ever: its outbox row is already delivered, and only a failed message may be retried. The message sweep's own minute schedule fails any message whose current generation has been delivered for more than 15 minutes without a receipt. It reads only the message and its outbox row; there is no second transport.

**Idempotency.** A repeat of the same send reuses the same browser `client_message_id`, which is unique per sender. So a lost response or an ambiguous timeout never creates a second message. The key is bound to the text: the same key with different text is refused (`AGENCY_MESSAGE_ID_REUSED`), and the composer mints a new key whenever the text changes. A repeat is answered before anything about the relationship is checked: it writes nothing, so a connection that closed or paused after the first send cannot make the sender read a message it already made as "not sent".

## 4. Its own lane

Both main inbound sweeps refuse an event type they do not handle, and the refusal is terminal. So message events are routed into their own lane:

- A `BEFORE INSERT` trigger stamps message events `processed_at` when they land, so the main sweep never sees them.
- The message sweep (`builder_network_apply_message_events` here, `builder_agency_apply_message_events` on the network) keeps its own stamp (`message_applied_at`).
- It runs each minute, and the network door also runs it once when an envelope lands.
- The main, media and rank sweeps are unchanged.
- Like the main sweep, it holds (never consumes) a connection's events while `identity_mismatch_since` is set, and replays them once the identity is repaired. Outbound it is the same rule: while the stamp is set, posting and retrying are refused (`AGENCY_CONNECTION_HALTED`), so nothing new crosses a disputed relationship. What was already queued is HELD rather than dropped: while a connection is disputed or has lost `stock:publish`, its pending message rows wait (`available_at = infinity`, which the outbox claim never reaches) and are released the moment it recovers. A row the worker had already claimed when the hold began is parked by `builder_network_park_held_message`, which re-decides under the connection's row lock, so a recovery landing at that moment is never overwritten by the park. A connection without `stock:publish` also cannot retry a message, and a builder message arriving over it is refused (`scope_revoked`).

**Order behind the activation.** A message written right after activating must not reach the network before the activation does, or it would be refused there as not open. The outbox claim promises no order between rows, so a posted message whose connection still holds an earlier undelivered `stock.selection.*` event waits behind it (15 s at a time, spending no delivery attempt). A dead activation does not hold it: the message then goes and is refused visibly.

**Failure handling.** One message that cannot be applied is retried on later sweeps. After five attempts it is dead-lettered with a critical operational event. It never blocks the messages after it: each claim takes its own row with `SKIP LOCKED`, and each row runs in its own exception block.

**Ordering.** Both ends sort by `(sent_at, id)`, using the writing side's server clock with the id as tie-breaker. Messages that arrive out of order settle into the order they were written.

## 5. What is re-checked when a message is applied

Every check below is made under a share lock on the rows it reads (the connection and the live activations), held until the message is written. So a revocation, dispute or withdrawal that lands at the same moment either commits first and is seen, or waits for the message. The same holds when a message is sent or retried.


A signed payload is not authority. When a message event is applied, all of these are checked against the rows:

- the connection is active (for new content; a receipt that landed before a revocation still settles the message it answers, since it carries no content);
- the property belongs to the connection's builder;
- the conversation id equals the derivation for this connection and property;
- the activation is live, and the builder still lists the property (an archived property keeps its history but takes nothing new, from either side);
- a message id already stored belongs to the same conversation and side.

Wrong builder, wrong workspace (connection), wrong property and a malformed message are each refused, stored nowhere, and answered with a refused receipt.

## 6. Reading and writing

**Command Centre.** The card is on the property page (`BuilderStockConversation`) and uses `builder-stock-marketplace`:

- `get_builder_conversation`: Listings view.
- `send_builder_message`: Listings edit.
- `retry_builder_message`: Listings edit, and only the writer.

**Builder Portal.** The Agencies → Messages tab uses `builder-portal-stock`:

- `get_agency_conversation`: `inventory` view.
- `send_agency_message`: `inventory` edit.
- `retry_agency_message`: `inventory` edit.

History is read from every conversation the property has held with its builder, so a revoked connection, or one replaced by a new relationship, never hides what was said. Only the conversation on the current active connection can be written to or retried in.

On both sides the sender is the session's user, and the request names no user or organisation. The thread re-reads itself every 10 seconds while the page is visible. Polling is the whole transport, and nothing depends on realtime.
