# How a screening request actually executes

Read this before touching `cross-portal-outbox-worker/screeningConsumer.ts`,
the inline execution path in `aml-cases`, `_shared/aml/partyScreening.pure.ts`,
`screeningPolicy.pure.ts`, or anything that decides whether a party has been
screened.

It exists because "AML screening never starts" was reported as a UI defect,
investigated three times, and was in fact **four independent faults stacked on
top of each other**, each of which fully explained the symptom on its own and
each of which was invisible from the layer above it. Every one of them is the
same shape: *a failure that reported as normal operation.*

## The path

```
operator presses Run screening
  └─ aml-cases writes aml.party_screening_subjects (state = queued)
     └─ and an integration_outbox row, event aml.screening.requested
        └─ pg_cron: cross-portal-outbox-worker, every minute
           └─ signed envelope: cron_signed_internal_headers → verifyInternal
              └─ screeningConsumer claims the subject (conditional UPDATE)
                 └─ resolveTenantProvider + getScreeningProvider
                    └─ local_lists screens against aml.sanctions_entries
                       └─ screening_checks + screening_matches
                          └─ subject projected: cleared / matched / error
```

`aml-cases` can also run the same consumer **inline** on the request, so a
screening does not have to wait a minute. Both paths converge on the same
code; neither is a fallback for the other being broken.

## The four faults, outermost first

### 1. The signing key had diverged. Nothing scheduled ran at all.

`cron_signed_internal_headers` signs with the Vault's `internal_edge_secret`;
`verifyInternal` verifies with the Edge runtime's `INTERNAL_EDGE_SECRET`. They
are two copies of one value and nothing kept them in step. Measured on
2026-08-18:

| caller | denials | since |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `agent_task_runner.invoke` | 7,160 | 2026-07-23 |
| `email_sync_cron.invoke` | 7,158 | 2026-07-23 |
| `cross_portal_outbox_worker.invoke` | 2,856 | 2026-08-16 |

**17,174 rejected invocations.** Every scheduled worker in the deployment was
dead, including the one that drains `aml.screening.requested`.

Nothing above this said so. `cron.job_run_details` showed 2,876 *succeeded*
runs, because what succeeded was the SQL that queued the HTTP request — not the
request. The only honest signal was `attempts = 0` on outbox rows that had been
waiting for hours, and a 403 in `net._http_response`.

Rotating both halves in one run is `.github/workflows/rotate-internal-edge-secret.yml`.
Neither copy can be read out to compare with the other, so the repair is to
issue a new value and write it to both stores — never to move a live secret
through a log, a commit or a clipboard.

### 2. The claim predicate could not be parsed. It had never once succeeded.

The consumer claims a subject with a conditional `UPDATE` so the provider runs
at most once per delivery. It was written as one PostgREST `.or()` string with
an ISO timestamp interpolated into it:

```ts
.or(`state.in.(queued,error),and(state.eq.processing,updated_at.lt.${cutoff})`)
```

PostgREST cannot parse that — a timestamp carries the `.` and `:` its filter
grammar treats as structural, so the embedded `and(...)` broke and the whole
expression was read as a column reference:

```
column party_screening_subjects.state does not exist
```

**The claim failed for every subject, every time, from the day it was written.**
Nobody had seen it because fault 1 meant the line was never reached.

It survived review because it reads correctly. It survived the test suite
because the consumer's own test double implemented `.or()` by pulling the
cutoff back out of the string with a regex — the code and its test agreed with
each other, and only the server disagreed. That double no longer emulates
`.or()` at all, and `screeningClaimPredicate.contract.test.ts` fails any filter
composed as a string or interpolating a value into a filter argument. It is the
same class as SQL string-building and has the same remedy: **never hand the
parser a sentence you assembled yourself.**

### 3. The error was discarded, so a database fault looked like a race.

The statement destructured `data` only. PostgREST returns `{ data: null, error }`
on any failure, and `data: null` is *also* what losing the claim race looks
like. So every database failure here was reported as "another worker has it,
retry" — the one outcome that converges nowhere. The inline caller swallowed
it, the worker retried for ever, and the subject sat `queued` with no
`error_category`, no `screening_check` and no case event.

That is exactly the silent stall the consumer exists to prevent, hiding inside
its own safety mechanism. The two cases are now separated: a genuine race still
retries, a database failure is recorded against the subject and named.

### 4. A configured-but-unfinished provider was reported as no provider.

There are three typed refusal codes. Two consumers collapsed them by hand:

```ts
err.code === 'provider_misconfigured' ? 'provider_misconfigured'
                                      : 'provider_not_configured'
```

which sends `simulator_blocked_in_production` to the wrong branch. Production's
row is `local_lists`, **active**, mode `simulator` — configured, and unable to
execute — so the administrator was told "No screening provider is configured
for this tenant. An administrator must configure one": a remedy asking for a
provider that already exists, while the real remedy was never named.

`technicalCategoryForRefusal` in `providerEnvironment.ts` is now the only
mapping. The distinction it protects is the reason both categories exist:
**not configured** means there is nothing there to fix; **misconfigured** means
something is there and is unfinished. Only the absence of a provider row is the
former.

## The second execution method: screening by hand

Everything above describes the **automated** path. There is a second one, and
it exists because the four faults above were only the loudest way that path can
stop: a provider can be down, a list can be stale, a name can need a judgement
no matcher makes. When that happens the obligation does not pause, so the MLRO
must be able to carry the screening out personally and record that they did.

**It is a METHOD, never an exemption.** Policy decides *whether* a screening is
required (`SCREENING_SCOPE.md`); this decides *how* a required one is carried
out. Nothing on this path writes `required`, touches `case_screening_scopes` or
`case_screening_perimeter`, or can spell `not_required` — the pure module does
not contain the string and a test asserts the operation does not either. Whether
policy required the screening is **read** from the recorded scope decision and
stored on the attempt (`policy_required` / `voluntary`), so a voluntary check
can never be read back afterwards as a mandatory one, or the reverse.

**It is the same record, not a parallel one.** A manual check is an ordinary
`aml.screening_checks` row and its candidates are ordinary
`aml.screening_matches` rows, so a manual possible match enters the existing
reviewer/MLRO adjudication path and every consumer of those tables keeps working
without knowing manual screening exists. The four outcomes map onto the status
vocabulary that was already there:

| MLRO concluded | `status` | party state | discharges the obligation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `no_match` | `clear` | `completed` | **yes** |
| `possible_match` | `matched` | `possible_match` (open candidates) | no — it becomes an adjudication |
| `confirmed_match` | `matched` | `confirmed_match` | no — it becomes an escalation |
| `unable_to_complete` | `failed` | `error` | no — it stays outstanding |

**`execution_mode` could not carry this and must not be made to.** That column
is `live` | `simulation`, and `aml-cases` treats `simulation` **or**
`authoritative = false` as non-authoritative. A screening the MLRO performed
against real published lists is live and is authoritative; it simply was not
performed by the provider. Manual-vs-automated is a second, orthogonal axis, so
it has its own column and `provider` reads `manual_mlro` rather than borrowing a
real provider's name.

**A manual "no match" carries its evidence or it is refused.** It is the claim
that a customer does not appear on a sanctions list, it is recorded as `clear`
like any other screening, and it is the cheapest thing in this product to record
carelessly — afterwards, a `clear` with nothing behind it is indistinguishable
from a screening that happened. So it must name at least one source actually
checked, at least one name actually searched, and a rationale of real length,
and that rule is enforced three times independently: in
`_shared/aml/manualScreening.pure.ts`, in the `record_manual_screening`
operation, and by the `screening_checks_manual_evidence` table constraint. The
rule is written **once** — `planManualScreening` is imported by both the dialog
and the edge function — so the browser cannot enable a submission the server
would reject, and the constraint catches any future code path that forgets.

`unable_to_complete` is deliberately held to a different bar: it asserts the
screening could **not** be concluded, which is the opposite of a claim about the
customer, so it carries a reason code instead of evidence, satisfies nothing,
and leaves the party outstanding.

**A screening the policy does not require may still be performed by hand,
and the policy survives the result.** Whether a screening is *owed* and
whether one may be *performed* are different questions. The panel originally
carried its own hand-written list of party states that could be screened
manually and it omitted `not_required`, so a case where sanctions screening
was not required offered no manual option at all — while the server would have
accepted the attempt and recorded it correctly as voluntary. "Not required"
had come to mean "not permitted". The panel now asks
`manualScreeningAdmissible`, the same module the edge function asks, so the
two cannot drift again.

What a voluntary attempt may CHANGE is its own decision,
`projectManualScreeningToSubject`, and it turns on one distinction:

- A voluntary **clear** leaves the party state at `not_required` and advances
  no freshness clock. `not_required` is a policy decision — no obligation
  arose and nobody had to be screened — and `no_match` is a screening result.
  They answer different questions and they coexist on the page. Overwriting
  the first with `completed` would make the case read as though sanctions
  screening had been required all along, and would promote an operator's
  optional check into the record of an obligation discharged. For the same
  reason it sets no refresh date: freshness measures an obligation, and a nag
  on a case that owes nothing is a fabricated one.
- A voluntary **unable to complete** also leaves the state alone. `error` is
  how Stage 5 says a required screening is outstanding, and a case that never
  needed one is not outstanding.
- A voluntary **finding** moves the state exactly as a required one does. A
  sanctions match is a match whoever went looking and whyever they did: it
  reaches the same `screening_matches` row, the same adjudication and the same
  escalation. "It was optional" is a statement about the obligation, never
  about the candidate.

**Provider readiness has no bearing on the manual method.** An unready
provider or a stale list is a fact about the *automated* method; the two are
rendered as separate lines under the sanctions heading for that reason. A
blocked provider is precisely when an MLRO needs to search a published list
themselves, so nothing about readiness stands between the MLRO branch and the
button — a test asserts that span of the panel mentions neither.

**A closed case still accepts compliance evidence, and now says so.** That is
the product's existing rule and this changed nothing about it: `closed` is
terminal in the case *status transition* table, which is why reopening is its
own authorised operation, and no screening, adjudication or PEP operation
checks case status. Record-keeping obligations outlive the file and a match
found afterwards still has to be recordable. The panel states it rather than
leaving an operator to infer it from a control that silently works.

**The browser supplies none of the facts that matter.** `performed_by` comes
from the session, `performed_at` from the server clock, the case from the
*subject* rather than a body-supplied id, and the MLRO role is checked by the
edge function — hiding the control in the panel is a convenience, not the
control. A satisfied manual screening advances `last_screened_at` and
`refresh_due_at` on the **same** interval the automated consumer uses (the
`rescreen_due` monitoring rule), so a manual result ages and falls due again
rather than standing for ever.

## The rules that keep biting

**A green cron run is not a delivered request.** pg_cron reports on the SQL it
ran, not on the HTTP call that SQL queued. The state that tells the truth is
`integration_outbox.attempts` and `net._http_response.status_code`.

**A failure must converge, and converging means saying which failure.** Every
technical outcome goes through one `recordTechnicalFailure`: state `error`, a
named `error_category`, a case event, and `last_screened_at` **untouched** — an
error is never a clear result and never counts as having screened anybody. A
subject that cannot converge because the platform is not ready is still
converged, with the reason; a stalled subject that reaches `aml-cases` is
converged on read (`SCREENING_STALL_SECONDS`) rather than left queued.

**Production never runs the simulator.** `decideProvider` refuses it as an
unfinished configuration rather than degrading to it, in either direction: a
key of `simulator`, or a real key still in simulator mode. This is what makes
"screening is not operational" impossible to confuse with "screening found
nothing", and it must not be relaxed to make a surface green.

**Screening against an empty list is not screening.** `local_lists` is the only
wired live adapter and it screens against `aml.sanctions_entries`. Promotion out
of simulator mode is earned by entries actually being written
(`decideProviderPromotion`), never asserted; and a list past
`LIST_STALE_AFTER_DAYS` is refused as stale rather than used quietly. Loading a
list that is years old would produce confident clears against a world that has
changed — which is worse than a visible refusal, because it is indistinguishable
from a real result.

**Two copies of one secret is a defect with a long fuse.** It failed silently
for 26 days across three workers before anything surfaced it. If a third copy
is ever introduced, it needs the same one-run rotation, or this recurs.
