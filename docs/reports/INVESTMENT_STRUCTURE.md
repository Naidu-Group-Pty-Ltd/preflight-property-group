# Investment report structure — the commentary strip (v3.0)

The Investment Location & Property Fit report ("Compass") is the highest-volume
document the product makes: **1,187 rows in `investment_reports`, 5–18 a week**.
This records why its structure changed in August 2026, and the production
measurements the change was made against.

Read this before touching `_shared/compassSectionRegistry.ts`,
`_shared/compassPostProcessor.ts`, `_shared/compassQAValidator.ts` or the prompt
in `generate-investment-report`.

## 1. What the document was

Measured against the live table, not against a fixture. Recent Compass reports:

| | per report |
|---|---:|
| Sections declared | 17 |
| Headings emitted | **96** (24.6 `##`, 68.1 `###`, 2.9 `####`) |
| Figures (`{{…}}` directives) | 53 |
| Table rows | 137 |
| **Editorial labels** | **90** |
| Characters inside those blocks | **24,713 — 16.9% of the document** |
| Total | 125,297 chars ≈ **86 rendered pages** |

The registry declared a **38–42 page band** and per-section word caps summing to
**9,170 words**. The report ran at roughly **21,000 words and 86 pages — 2.3× its
own budget** — and a sixth of it was the document explaining itself.

The five labels, counted across 56 reports:

| label | occurrences |
|---|---:|
| What This Means | 1,075 |
| NPC view | 322 |
| What to watch | 307 |
| Why this matters | 224 |
| Key takeaway | 204 |

## 2. Three reasons, and the third is the useful one

### The prompt contradicted itself

Two instructions said *after everything*:

- the **system message**, on every call: *"After any table or data point, add a
  'What This Means' paragraph explaining the practical implications"*
- the **per-section task**, on every section: *"After every visual/table/
  significant data point, include only a brief 'What This Means' explanation"*

Two said *one per section* — `compassStyleRules` and the Compass-40 overlay's
*"ONE 'What This Means' box per section maximum — not after every few
paragraphs"*.

The local trigger beats the global cap. The prompt also demanded *"3–4
visualisations per chapter"* and production delivered 53 figures a report; 53
figures × "after every visual" ≈ the 36 *What This Means* blocks observed. The
arithmetic is exact.

The other three labels came from one place: a **"MANDATORY WRITING STYLE — every
narrative section uses this 4-block format"** (Key takeaway → Why this matters →
What to watch → NPC view), mirrored as a comment in the registry.

### The enforcement existed and never ran on this report

`compassPostProcessor` and `compassQAValidator` already implemented per-section
word caps, a decision-box cap, the page-pressure ladder and a page-band check.

**Neither had a caller in the generation path.** Both were imported only by
`condense-investment-report`, which produces the derived snapshot and briefing
variants — 44 rows. `generate-investment-report`, which produced all 1,124
Compass reports, called neither.

The only gate that did run was `validateSectionContent`, and every rule in it
pushed one way: a penalty for being **too short**, a penalty for **fewer than
three headings**, and **no upper bound of any kind**. `maxWordCount` never became
a limit — it only sized the model call, at `maxWordCount × 4` capped at 5,000 and
then multiplied by **1.6** again for Compass, handing a 650-word section about
4,160 tokens ≈ 3,100 words. **4.8× its own cap.**

### Where it did run, it was looking for the wrong string

```ts
const DECISION_BOX_RE = /^(#{2,4})\s*(what this means|what this means for you|takeaway)\s*$/i;
```

Heading form only. Counted across 56 production reports:

| form | occurrences |
|---|---:|
| `**What This Means**` (bold lead-in) | **4,161** |
| `### NPC view` (heading) | 424 |
| `What to watch` (bare line) | 458 |
| **total** | **5,043** |
| **matched** | **11 — 0.2%** |

82.5% of labels are the bold form the regex could not see, and three of the five
labels were not in its alternation at all. Production also writes the separator
**inside** the emphasis — `**Key takeaway:**`, not `**Key takeaway**:` — which is
its own trap for anything matching this class.

## 3. What the document is now

Eleven client-facing sections plus back matter, ~23 pages, ~5,010 words.

| # | Section | Pages | Words |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | Cover Page | 1 | 60 |
| 2 | Executive Verdict | 2 | 450 |
| 3 | Property & Locality Snapshot | 2 | 300 |
| 4 | Why This Location Matters | 3 | 700 |
| 5 | **Demand Drivers** | 3 | 750 |
| 6 | **Amenity & Access** | 3 | 600 |
| 7 | Market Positioning | 2 | 450 |
| 8 | Property Fit Within the Suburb | 2 | 450 |
| 9 | Risk Dashboard | 2 | 500 |
| 10 | Due Diligence Checklist | 1 | 250 |
| 11 | Final Recommendation | 1 | 250 |
| — | Appendix, Source Notes & Disclaimer | 1 | 250 |

**Demand Drivers** merges population/housing demand, tenant & buyer profile and
employment & economic linkages — one question, who wants to live here and why.
**Amenity & Access** merges education, retail/healthcare/lifestyle and transport
— one question, what is nearby and how long it takes to reach. Both merges are
consolidations the v2.0 `purpose` strings already demanded ("RENDER ONCE", "Do
NOT repeat … elsewhere") and that the prompt could not deliver while each was a
separate section.

**Client Reading Guide is removed.** It was a prose contents page — 5,068 chars
listing the sections that followed with a gloss each, ending in a *What This
Means* restating the reading order — and the typeset document has a real
contents page.

The writing style is now three steps: state the finding in the sentence that
introduces the data, show the data, move on.

## 4. The rules that bite

**A label is removed with the paragraph beneath it, and never a figure.**
`stripEditorialBlocks` stops at the first structural line — a heading, a `{{…}}`
directive, a table row, a list item or a rule. A strip that swallowed a figure
would remove the data *and* the commentary, which is strictly worse than leaving
both. Verified against real report text: 4 figures and 5 table rows in, 4 and 5
out, 6 labels in, 0 out.

**The inline form keeps its sentence.** `**Key takeaway:** Banora Point sits in a
coastal growth corridor…` is a finding with a label in front of it, not a
restatement. The label comes off; the sentence stays. Blanket removal would have
gutted the Final Recommendation, which was **39% editorial by character** — the
four labels *were* that section. Its prompt was rewritten to produce a verdict
label, unlabelled rationale and an actions list before the strip was enabled.

**A labelled heading is removed whole, whatever trails it.** Production writes
`### NPC view – overall recommendation`. Read as the inline form it would lose
the `###` and leave "overall recommendation" hanging above the opinion it was
titling.

**Whole-line beats inline.** `**What This Means:**` matches both patterns, and
the inline one can treat the trailing `**` as its content — leaving a bare `**`
on the page. Block form is tested first.

**A report banked under a different section list is regenerated, not resumed.**
`last_completed_section` is a raw index into the *current* registry, so a row
stopped at 8 of 17 resuming under the 12-section list would splice sections 8–11
of the new structure onto 0–7 of the old — a document with two Population
sections, no Demand Drivers, and nothing on the row to say so. `total_sections`
records which list the banked content was written against, and a mismatch starts
the report again. It costs one regeneration, for in-flight reports only.

**The row's `total_sections` beats the registry everywhere it is read.** ~1,120
stored rows carry 17. If the registry fallback won, every completed one would
read as over 100%.

**A section name is load-bearing downstream.** No current report numbers its
sections, so `TITLED_SECTION_CHARTS` attaches infographics **by title** and
`reportSplitRegistry` routes the derived FIN/PLDD variants by heading substring —
and `fork-investment-report` drops an unmatched heading from both variants
silently. Both were updated with the new names. `Demand Drivers` matched no split
route at all before that change.

**A merged section claims at most two charts.** Demand Drivers matches three
patterns' worth of titles, and charts are claimed once each across the document.
Without `MAX_CHARTS_PER_SECTION` a merged section would take three, on a page
that already carries the model's own two figures.

## 5. Verification

```
npx vitest run src/lib/reports src/lib/reportDesign src/lib/brandDesign src/components/reports
deno test --allow-net --allow-read supabase/functions/condense-investment-report/compassPostProcessor_test.ts
npm run lint && npm run audit:style && npm run build
node scripts/security/check-edge-functions.mjs
```

The specs that carry this change:

- `src/lib/reports/__tests__/compassEditorialStrip.spec.ts` — the strip against
  the three forms production writes, and against what it must not touch. Every
  fixture is copied from a stored row rather than invented, because the defect
  being replaced was a matcher written against an imagined shape.
- `src/lib/reports/__tests__/compassRegistryParity.spec.ts` — the two registry
  copies, field by field, plus the structural invariants (page budget inside the
  band, word budget under 6,000, no `allowDecisionBox`).
- `src/lib/reports/investment/__tests__/currentFormat.spec.ts` — charts still
  reach the merged sections.
- `src/components/reports/progress/__tests__/selectors.pure.spec.ts` — a row's
  own `total_sections` wins over the registry.

**Measuring a real report.** The label matcher can be run against production
directly, which is how the 0.2% figure above was taken:

```sql
with r as (
  select id, report_content c from investment_reports
  where report_variant='compass' and report_content is not null
    and created_at > now() - interval '120 days'
), l as (select r.id, t.l line from r, lateral unnest(string_to_array(r.c, E'\n')) t(l))
select count(*) filter (where line ~* '^\s*(#{1,6}\s*)?(\*\*|__)?\s*(what this means|npc view|what to watch|why this matters|key takeaway)\s*[:：–—-]?\s*(\*\*|__)?\s*[:：–—-]?\s*$') as labels,
       count(distinct id) as reports
from l;
```

Simulating the strip's exact line rules over 12 real reports removes **13.9% of
characters**, 97 label lines each.

**Fixtures must move with production.**
`src/lib/reports/investment/__tests__/fixtures.ts` `currentFormat()` builds the
document the generator writes *today*, and `INVESTMENT.md` §5 and §7 are both
about what happens when it and production disagree — a fixture 8.3× thinner per
section than the real thing, and every page-economy number in the programme
taken against it.

## 6. What this change did not do

- **The 1,187 stored reports are untouched.** No backfill, no re-render, no
  regeneration. A client holding a PDF keeps that document.
- **The render side is untouched.** `COVERAGE.md` records that the design system
  renders **0 of 1,162** investment reports — the markdown *is* the report on
  every live path, so this lands entirely in the generator.
- **The `{{…}}` chart vocabulary stays.** The figures are data; `INVESTMENT.md`
  §1 is the record of wiring them to real chart primitives. Only the count is
  capped, at two a section.
- **The financial exclusions are unchanged.** The Compass hard rules keeping
  price, yield and LVR out of this report are exactly as they were.
- **`condense-investment-report`'s `TIER_CONFIG` is unchanged.** The snapshot and
  briefing variants re-generate from their own legacy prompts against legacy
  heading names and are decoupled from this registry. They will drift further;
  that is separate work.
