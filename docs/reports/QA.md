# Report Q&A exports — the contract

The seventh format on the shared report design system, and the first whose
payload is prose.

Every format migrated before this one had a typed payload: `Measure` fields,
arithmetic, columns somebody declared in code. This one has a `text` column
holding Markdown a model wrote. That single difference decides most of what
follows — the sections are discovered rather than declared, the page budget has
to be fitted rather than summed, and the central piece of new engineering is a
Markdown → design-system renderer that did not exist anywhere in this repo.

## 1 · What was there before

**Four PDF implementations across three libraries, and a fifth with no caller.**

| # | Path | Library | Reachable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `src/components/reports/QAPDFGenerator.tsx` (467 lines) | jsPDF | **No — dead code** |
| 2 | `ConversationReportEditor.tsx:135` — the structured report | jsPDF | Yes, via `ConversationExport` |
| 3 | `MessageReportEditor.tsx:144` — one answer | jsPDF | Yes, `ReportQA.tsx:3859` |
| 4 | `report-qa/index.ts:3715` `generate-qa-pdf` — the transcript | pdf-lib | Yes, `ReportQA.tsx:2251` |
| 5 | `report-qa/index.ts:3651` `export-pdf` | a hand-written `%PDF-1.4` string | No caller |

### D1 — the best-maintained copy is the one nobody can reach

`QAPDFGenerator` is referenced only by a comment (`MessageReportEditor.tsx:122`,
*"mirrors QAPDFGenerator template"*). Its code was copy-pasted twice and has
since drifted: `QAPDFGenerator` measures table rows with `calcRowHeight`
(`:142-151`), while `ConversationReportEditor` still uses a fixed
`rowHeight = 8` (`:268`) plus `doc.text(..., { maxWidth })`, so **multi-line
table cells overlap**. 105 of the record's 562 answers contain a pipe table.

Four copies is how a fix lands in one and not the others. One is how it stops.

### D2 — three filename conventions, one of them invalid

`Summary - ${reportNames.join(', ')}.pdf` (unsanitised, so the commas land in the
filename; and its no-reports fallback is
`Q&A Summary - ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}.pdf`, which with no locale
argument produces `8/2/2026` — **slashes in a filename**),
`${title}_report.pdf`, and `${title}_message.pdf`.

### D3 — two unrelated hardcoded palettes, neither a token

Client side: `15,18,25` ground and `191,155,80` gold — the `#BF9B50` this design
system retired — plus `59,130,246`, Tailwind blue-500, used as a rule under an
H1. Server side: `rgb(0.07,0.2,0.38)` and `rgb(0.89,0.71,0.31)`. All three client
copies also print the fixed subtitle **"Investment Property Analysis"** at the
top of every content page of a Q&A document.

### D4 — every non-ASCII character is thrown away

`sanitizeForPDF` (`QAPDFGenerator.tsx:24-42`) transliterates a handful of glyphs
and then drops every remaining non-ASCII codepoint outside a Latin-1 whitelist.
Measured against the corpus that discards:

- smart punctuation from **389 of 562 answers** (`— – … ' ' " "`);
- every `✓ ✗ ⚠ → ≤ ≥` from **187**;
- **every non-Latin name**, which is what `fonts-noto-cjk` is installed for
  (`typography.pure.ts:54`).

The *architecture* is right — an allow-list, because a deny-list of bad glyphs
can never be complete. It is correct for jsPDF, whose built-in faces are
WinAnsi-encoded. It is entirely unnecessary against WeasyPrint.

### D5 — the cover is a house asset on a white-label tenant's document

`/templates/npc-qa-cover.jpg` hardcoded in all three client copies; the server
path instead copies page 1 of a single global `report_structure_templates` row
where `template_type = 'qa_export'`. Neither is the tenant's own asset.

### D6 — citations never reach any export

`report_qa_messages.citations` is persisted by `buildStructuredCitations`
(`report-qa/index.ts:969-984`) and shown on screen by `Citations.tsx`. Every
exporter redeclares its own thin `Message` of `role | content | timestamp`
(`ConversationExport.tsx:14-18`), so citations, model version, attachments, tool
invocations and pinned state are dropped before any renderer sees them. A Q&A PDF
today carries no source attribution at all.

Zero messages in the record have a citation, so this is a latent defect rather
than a live one — which is exactly when it is cheap to close.

### D7 — the format was invisible to the design programme

No `docs/reports/QA.md`, no archetype, no ledger, and **no test anywhere named
any Q&A export**. `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md:378` classified Q&A as a Track B format and
never specified it.

## 2 · What the record actually holds

Measured before the work: 244 conversations, 1,125 messages, 2 distinct authors.
0 shares, 0 feedback rows, 0 tool invocations, 0 agent-mode conversations, 0
client-linked conversations, 0 citations.

Markdown constructs across the 562 assistant answers
(`coalesce(edited_content, content)`):

| construct | answers | | construct | answers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| inline bold | 392 (70%) | | blockquote | 18 |
| bullet list | 321 (57%) | | inline code | 6 |
| ATX heading | 270 (48%) | | fenced code | 6 |
| inline italic | 193 (34%) | | thematic break | 3 |
| ordered list | 181 (32%) | | bare URL | 7 |
| pipe table | 105 (19%) | | markdown link | **0** |
| smart punctuation | 389 (69%) | | markdown image | 1 |

Heading levels: `#` 290, `##` 1,214, `###` 1,536, `####` 192, `#####` 5.
Tables: p90 **5** columns, max **14**; 101 rows in the largest.

Sizes: answer p50 2,203 / p90 10,575 / max 33,377 characters. Structured report
avg 8,193 / max 18,912, bounded by its producer's `max_completion_tokens: 8192`.
Conversation p50 870 / p90 21,387 / **max 354,406** across 35 exchanges — over a
hundred and fifty printed pages.

Glyphs: dingbats U+2600–27BF in 98 answers, arrows in 89, **VS16/ZWJ in 93**,
pictographs in 16.

**204 of 244 conversations have `created_by` NULL.** `resolveReportQaAccess`
returns `denied` for those unless the caller is a superadmin — which is true of
every existing Q&A action, so the new route inherits the behaviour rather than
creating it. Worth knowing before anyone reports the route as broken.

---

## 3 · What was built

```
supabase/functions/_shared/reports/reportQa/
  markdown.pure.ts     Markdown → design-system HTML. The new engineering.
  payload.pure.ts      Three subjects, turns, citations, the budgets.
  normalise.pure.ts    Two tables → a document, or a refusal.
  sections.pure.ts     The discovered spine, and the exact page fit.
  render.pure.ts       The document.
  route.pure.ts        Request, filename, storage path, response.
supabase/functions/render-report-qa-pdf/index.ts
supabase/migrations/20260820000000_report_qa_render_path.sql
src/lib/reports/reportQa/                 six bridges + request/deliver
src/components/report-qa/ReportQaDownloadButton.tsx
```

One shared move: `neutraliseUrls` from
`reports/cashFlowComparison/normalise.pure.ts:131` to
`_shared/reports/text.pure.ts`, re-exported so that format's callers and its spec
are unchanged. Two formats need it; two copies is the defect the move prevents.

One shared edit: the `report-qa` archetype in `reportDesign/structure.pure.ts` —
one union member, one map entry, `FULL_SLOTS`, `contents: true`,
`pageBudget: [4, 30]`.

---

## 4 · Three subjects, one renderer

| Subject | What it is | Spine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `structured` | `report_qa_conversations.structured_report` — the model's write-up | cover → contents → its own headings become the chapters → sources → closing |
| `answer` | one assistant message, `edited_content` winning over `content` | cover → contents → the answer as chapters, the question above it → sources → closing |
| `transcript` | every exchange as it happened | cover → contents → a chapter per exchange up to twelve, then the rest in one → sources → closing |

`structured` is the only subject that can call a model, and only when the
conversation has no write-up stored and the caller asked for one.

**No charts, and that is a decision.** Every other migrated format has them. This
document is prose, and the only numbers available — message counts, answer
lengths, model mix — are not what the reader wants. Parsing figures out of the
model's own sentences to chart them would put a second answer beside the one the
prose already gives, which is the failure this programme removes: the Borrowing
Capacity waterfall was deleted for disagreeing with the figure beneath it.

---

## 5 · The Markdown renderer

### The stylesheet decides the grammar

`css.pure.ts` styles `h1, h2, h3` (`:635`), `h4` (`:649`), `p` (`:660`),
`strong` (`:666`), `em` (`:667`), `a` (`:668`), `ul, ol` (`:673`), `li` (`:674`)
and the whole `table.data` system (`:239-344`). It styles **nothing** for `h5`,
`h6`, `blockquote` as an element, `code`, `pre`, `hr` or `img`.

Two consequences, both of which changed the obvious design:

1. **`h4` is not a smaller heading.** It is IBM Plex Mono, uppercase, tracked, at
   caption size — the comment at `css.pure.ts:647` says it is the same object as
   `.eyebrow`. A real level to demote onto, but a *labelled sub-section*.
2. **`<pre>` is disqualified.** WeasyPrint's UA sheet gives it
   `white-space: pre`, and there is no `overflow-wrap` or `word-break` rule
   anywhere in the sheet, so a 120-character line of JSON would run off the trim
   edge of a client's document. A fenced block becomes a callout of `<code>`
   separated by `<br>`, which wraps.

`reportQaStylesheet.spec.ts` reads `css.pure.ts` and fails if the module can emit
an element it does not dress.

### The grammar

| markdown | becomes |
| --- | --- |
| paragraph | `<p>` |
| ATX / setext heading | `<h2>`/`<h3>`/`<h4 id>`, demoted relative to the answer's own shallowest heading, clamped at 4 |
| bullet / ordered list | `<ul>`/`<ol>` + `<li>`, depth ≤ 3, deeper items flattened not dropped |
| GFM pipe table | `renderDataTable` — ≤ 6 columns portrait, 7–12 landscape, > 12 keeps twelve and names the rest in a sidenote |
| blockquote | `renderCallout('neutral', 'Note', …)` |
| fenced code | `renderCallout(informative, lang, '<p><code>…<br>…</code></p>')` |
| thematic break | dropped, counted |
| image | alt text only |
| `[a](b)` | the text plus the neutralised host, **never an anchor** |

**Heading demotion is relative, not absolute.** Models are inconsistent about
whether they open at `#` or `##`, and an answer written entirely in `##`/`###`
must render with the same hierarchy as one written in `#`/`##`. And a single
top-level heading over deeper ones is a *title*, not a section — the shape
`summarize-conversation`'s own brief asks for (`report-qa/index.ts:3060`: one `#`
over eight `##`). Taking it as the only chapter gave an eleven-page document a
one-entry contents page, which is how that rule was found.

### Escape first, then emphasis

Both orderings can be made correct; this one is chosen for its **failure mode**.
Escape-first puts `escapeHtml` at one auditable call; get it wrong and the page
prints `&lt;strong&gt;`, which the first test catches. Escape-last is correct only
if every serialiser branch remembers, and the branch that forgets is an
XSS-shaped hole that renders identically to correct output in every test that
does not specifically probe it.

It rests on one property, which is itself a test: `escapeHtml` produces only
`&amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; &#39;`, and **none of `*`, `_`, backtick, `[`, `]`, `(`,
`)` appears in any of those five entities**. Add a sixth entity and the spec
fails rather than a client's document.

### Two ordering rules that are bugs if reversed

- **`sanitiseGlyphs` runs before `neutraliseUrls`.** Stripping a zero-width
  character is what *creates* a scheme-relative URL: `/​/` is inert until
  the zero-width space goes. Reversed, the render throws.
- **`markdownToPlainText` neutralises URLs too.** Questions, contents entries and
  running heads reach the page without passing through the block scanner. Eight
  user messages in the record carry a URL, and without this every one of them
  fails the render with an error naming no field and no line. Found by a test
  that put the URL in a question rather than in an answer.

### Glyphs — scripts are kept, symbol blocks are enumerated

The container installs DejaVu, Liberation, Noto, Noto CJK, Inter, Roboto and Lato
plus the COPY'd Cinzel / Playfair / IBM Plex Mono. **No colour-emoji font.**

The rule: a codepoint is emitted unless it is a control or format character, or
it falls in one of five enumerated symbol ranges and is neither in the keep-list
nor transliterated. Scripts are never touched.

**The first version got this wrong and shipped a copy of D4.** It dropped
everything at or above U+2600 unless explicitly kept — which reads as a safe
allow-list and is not one, because Han starts at U+4E00. A rendered proof
carrying `A non-Latin name: 李小龍 and Ελληνικά` came back reading `A non-Latin
name: and Ελληνικά`. The name was gone. Found by looking at the page, which is
the only way that class of defect is ever found, and now pinned by
`markdown.spec.ts`.

Stripping **VS16** is the highest-value single line — 93 answers. It asks for the
emoji presentation of a character with a good text form; with no colour-emoji
font the engine either ignores it or draws `.notdef`. Removing it turns `⚠️` into
`⚠` and `1️⃣` into `1`, at the cost of nothing.

### Bounds

| cap | value | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAX_MARKDOWN_CHARS` | 65,536 | Twice the largest answer; the same figure as `MAX_SALVAGE_CHARS` |
| `MAX_TABLE_COLS` | 12 | `renderBandedMatrix`'s own landscape budget |
| `MAX_PORTRAIT_TABLE_COLS` | 6 | At seven, a prose cell gets 24.9mm ≈ 70pt in the 174mm measure |
| `MAX_LIST_DEPTH` | 3 | `padding-left: 14pt` per level; depth 4 has eaten 20mm |
| `MAX_TRANSCRIPT_LINES` | 950 | 25 pages of body, keeping 96% of conversations whole |

**The module never throws.** A caller passing 350 KB gets a truncated document
and a `renderCallout('caution', …)` naming the residue exactly — the same choice
`measure.pure.ts:249` makes returning `null`, and for the same reason: a pure
formatter that throws takes the whole render down and the caller has no better
recovery.

---

## 6 · The page budget is fitted, not summed

Every other format sums its declared section budgets and checks the total against
the archetype band. This one cannot: the sections come from the content, and a
transcript's pages come as much from per-exchange furniture as from prose.

Both facts were learned the hard way.

1. The first budget was in **characters**. A 42,000-character conversation of 70
   short exchanges runs to about 45 pages; the same 42,000 characters in five
   long exchanges runs to about 15. A character cap admits the first and a turn
   cap refuses the second, so neither alone is a budget.
2. The second was in **estimated lines**, and the estimate was ~40% low against
   structured answers, because a four-row table is seven printed lines for a
   hundred characters. A 70-exchange transcript claimed 30 pages and would have
   printed 41.

So `fitTranscript` drops one exchange at a time and re-prices the spine it would
build, until `spinePageBudget` is inside the band. Exact — no estimate stands
between the rule and the thing it is a rule about — and a handful of iterations
on the four conversations in the record that reach it. The coarse character
budget stays in the normaliser, doing the one job it is good at: refusing 350 KB
before a scanner ever sees it.

### Measured against real renders

Ten fixtures through local WeasyPrint. Claimed is what the spine says; actual is
what `pdfinfo` reports.

| shape | claimed | actual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| one short answer | 5 | 5 |
| a typical answer (table, lists, quote) | 7 | 7 |
| an answer with an 11-column table | 7 | 7 |
| an answer full of symbols and non-Latin names | 5 | 5 |
| the largest single answer | 17 | 17 |
| a structured report | 17 | 17 |
| a p50 transcript | 5 | 5 |
| a p90 transcript (5 exchanges) | 14 | 14 |
| a 20-exchange transcript | 30 | 29 |
| a 35-exchange transcript | 30 | 29 |

Band `[4, 30]`. The floor is the arithmetic minimum — cover, contents, one
chapter, closing — and exists to catch a spine that collapsed rather than to
predict a page count; the Client Details band was estimated and refused a
legitimate document on its first render.

### What the renders found

- **The lede and the truncation callout disagreed by six exchanges.** The
  narrative was built in the normaliser from its own estimate; the exact fit cut
  further. The page read "19 of 20 exchanges" three lines above "This document
  carries 13 of 20 exchanges". The narrative is now rebuilt from the fitted
  count, and `render.spec.ts` asserts the document gives one number.
- **A landscape table cost two pages the row count knew nothing about.**
  `renderPage('landscape-table', …)` breaks the portrait flow before and after
  it. `LANDSCAPE_BREAK_LINES` closes it.
- **Nested lists were invalid HTML.** The obvious loop puts the sublist beside
  its parent `<li>` rather than inside it, and WeasyPrint renders it at the
  parent's own indent — so the nesting the author wrote is simply not on the
  page. Invisible to the type checker, visible on the page.

---

## 7 · The render path

`supabase/functions/render-report-qa-pdf/index.ts`.

1. `verifyAuthOrNativeUser`; the service-role identity is refused because it is
   not a person.
2. `requireModulePermission(actor, 'report_qa', 'can_view')` — **not `reports`**.
   `permissions.ts:37-38` maps both Q&A tables to `report_qa`; gating on
   `reports` would let someone read a conversation through a report route they
   could not read directly.
3. **`resolveReportQaAccess`** for the conversation itself, with `isSuperadmin`
   supplied — the resolver takes it as a flag rather than looking it up, and
   without it a superadmin passes the module gate and is refused by the
   conversation gate. This route does not invent a second ownership rule.
4. Two reads, with **`error` checked before `data`** on both. A failed query that
   returns nothing is not an empty conversation, and printing it as one is a
   transcript with exchanges silently missing.
5. `structured` with nothing stored and `generateIfMissing` set → the same call
   `summarize-conversation` makes, **metered** through `logApiUsage`, and
   persisted so the second render is free.
6. Brand snapshotted then referenced; the cover from the tenant's own asset;
   `assertSafeRenderResources` before the POST.
7. `validateSpine` problems are fatal. This is the only format whose sections
   come from model output, so it is the only one where an illegal spine can
   happen at runtime.
8. No fallback. Every attempt leaves a row in `report_qa_renders`.
9. Optionally writes the attachment shape `PDFAttachmentMessage.tsx:39` already
   reads, so the in-place email composer reaches the new document unchanged.

**Filename:** `Q_and_A_<Report|Answer|Transcript>_<Title>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.pdf`,
replacing all three conventions in D2. The `[^a-zA-Z0-9] → _` rule the legacy
uses is kept exactly, so old and new files sort together.

**Storage:** `qa_exports` — the private bucket the legacy server path already
writes to — at `report-qa/<conversationId>/<date>/<uuid>-<name>`.

**Metering.** This is the first route in the programme that can spend tokens.
`summarize-conversation` makes the same gpt-5.2 call today and logs nothing; a
new route is not the place to inherit that. `report_qa_renders.generated_summary`
is how a spend in `api_usage_log` traces back to the document that caused it.

---

## 8 · The front end — additive

| Surface | Before | Added |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ReportQA.tsx:2251` "Export PDF" | pdf-lib transcript → chat attachment | the typeset document beside it, same attachment shape |
| `ConversationExport.tsx:150` dropdown | "Export as Structured Report (AI)" → jsPDF | a typeset entry above it |
| `MessageReportEditor.tsx` footer | jsPDF single answer | the typeset answer beside it |

Nothing was removed. The four raw exports (`.txt` / `.csv` / `.md` / `.json`) are
untouched and are the uncapped escape hatch the truncation callout points at —
`legacyPathStays.spec.ts` asserts they still exist for exactly that reason.

`requestReportQaPdf` takes **no legacy fallback**. Substituting a jsPDF export
whose tables overlap, whose punctuation has been transliterated to ASCII and
whose cover is our letterhead rather than the tenant's would send somebody a
different document from the one they chose. On an undeployed route it fails,
naming the exports that work.

### Names that must stay

`QAPDFGenerator.tsx` is dead code and **stays** — removing it was outside this
migration's scope. `legacyPathStays.spec.ts` records that it is unreachable, so
nobody ports a fix into a file no one can reach. So do
`ConversationReportEditor`, `MessageReportEditor`, `generate-qa-pdf` and the four
raw exports.

---

## 9 · Deliberate losses

Recorded here because each is a decision, not an oversight.

- **Emphasis inside a table cell.** `renderDataTable` calls `escapeHtml` on every
  cell, so `**Yes**` would print its asterisks. Markers are stripped instead: a
  cell loses weight, not words, and the table is already differentiated by mono
  uppercase heads, banding and tabular figures. The alternative — a forked table
  emitter — would cost alignment, `tabular-nums` and the `<th scope="row">` that
  makes the table navigable, which is the point of the migration.
- **The thematic break.** It carries no content and the design system's own block
  rhythm already separates. 3 answers.
- **Columns past twelve.** Kept twelve, named the rest in a sidenote. The corpus
  max is 14, so this case is real.
- **Code in a callout rather than `<pre>`.** See §5.
- **Pictographs.** Dropped, leaving the words — the house vocabulary is
  decorative-prefix-plus-word, so `🏠 Owner Occupied` becomes `Owner Occupied`
  and reads perfectly. `🔴 🟠 🟢` are dropped rather than mapped to `●`, because
  three identical discs destroy the distinction they were carrying.
- **The transcript's tail past the page band.** Said on the page, counted in the
  ledger, and the uncapped `.md` export is named as where to get the rest.

---

## 10 · Tests

| File | Guards |
| --- | --- |
| `reportQaSourceOfTruth.spec.ts` | one bridge per canonical module; import discipline; purity; no PDF library |
| `markdown.spec.ts` | the grammar, the escape invariant, the resource policy, the glyph policy, the bounds, determinism |
| `normalise.spec.ts` | turn pairing, citations, refusals, the transcript budget, the framing sentence |
| `render.spec.ts` | the contents page matches what was printed; the spine is legal and in band; one exchange count; the tenant's brand; escaping |
| `stylesheet.spec.ts` | every element the module writes has a rule in `css.pure.ts` or an exemption with a reason |
| `legacyPathStays.spec.ts` | all five legacy paths still exist and are still wired; the new control returns a Blob; the route's two gates |

230 assertions. Five were verified by **deliberately breaking the thing they
guard** — the glyph/URL ordering, the CJK keep, positional table keys, the escape
order and list nesting — and each failed exactly one test.

Three of the assertions were themselves wrong on first writing, all in the same
way: they read a module's **prose** rather than its code, because these files'
doc comments name the legacy libraries they replace. Comments are stripped first
now. It is the same mistake the copied import check makes when a doc comment ends
in `from '`.

---

## 11 · Deployment

1. ~~Apply `supabase/migrations/20260820000000_report_qa_render_path.sql`.~~
   **Applied to production** — `report_qa_renders`, its six indexes and the
   superadmin-only SELECT policy exist, and the migration is recorded under its
   own version so `supabase db push` does not attempt it a second time (it
   would fail: `CREATE POLICY` has no `IF NOT EXISTS`).
2. Deploy `render-report-qa-pdf` — **still pending**. `npm run deploy:report-qa-render`.

The DDL was executed against production inside a transaction — including an
insert against real conversation and message rows, to prove the shape is usable
and not merely creatable — and rolled back, with `to_regclass` confirmed null
afterwards. It has since been applied for real.

### What an undeployed route looks like from the app

Worth recording, because it cost a support round-trip and the message was
actively misleading.

An absent function is a 404 from the **Supabase gateway**, not from the
function, and a gateway 404 carries no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. So the
browser refuses the response, `fetch` rejects with `TypeError: Failed to fetch`,
and `invokeSecureFunction` rewrites that into *"Network/CORS error calling
render-report-qa-pdf. Please check the function deployment and auth/CORS
configuration."* — which is what a person pressing **Typeset PDF (WeasyPrint)**
saw. Nothing about this route's CORS is wrong; it never ran.

`requestReportQaPdf` was written to catch exactly this and say so, but its
`looksUndeployed` matched on `failed to fetch` — a string that no longer
survives the transport. It matches the transport's `network` flag now (minus
`provider_timeout`, which is the opposite failure: the route answered, slowly),
so the undeployed case reads as *"render-report-qa-pdf has not been deployed to
this project"* and names the exports that do work.

The deploy is a CLI job rather than an MCP one: the route pulls in 32 shared
modules through `../_shared/**`, and the CLI is what resolves them.

## 12 · How this format got onto the Investment Compass families

This section used to explain why it could not be. The argument was sound about
the vocabulary it was written against, and it named the two things that would
have to change. Both changed, so the section now records what they were and what
holds the result in place.

### What blocked it

The Template Builder's blocks had **no Markdown renderer and no block that
accepted HTML**. `text-block` escapes its body, which is correct — it is the
reason a model-authored string cannot inject markup into a client's document —
and the consequence was that an answer bound to one printed its own source:
`## Yield analysis`, `**gross yield**` and `| Gross yield | 3.71% |` all set as
body copy. Against the corpus that was not an edge case: **394 of the 565
answers (70%) carry inline bold**, 271 (48%) an ATX heading, 315 (56%) a bullet
list and 106 (19%) a pipe table.

And the structure is discovered at render time against heights a master declares
at build time:

| | p50 | p90 | max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| answer, characters | 2,193 | 10,591 | **33,377** |
| sections discovered in an answer | 1 | 16 | **63** |

### 1 · `markdown-block` takes source, not HTML

The half of the argument that had to stay true is the escaping. A block that
accepted rendered HTML would be a hole in `PRODUCTION_SAFE_BLOCK_TYPES` — a
security allow-list — for exactly the content least able to be trusted.

So the block takes Markdown **source** and renders it itself, through
`_shared/reports/markdown.pure.ts`: the programme's only Markdown
implementation, already shared with this route, and **escape-first** —
`escapeHtml` runs at one auditable call before any parsing. That makes safety a
property of the renderer rather than of the caller: there is no input to the
block that produces markup the model chose, whatever is bound to it. A second
implementation would have been a second set of escaping decisions.

`markdownBlock.spec.ts` asserts it on the **tag set** the output contains rather
than on substrings — a fully-escaped `href=&quot;javascript:…&quot;` still
contains the text `javascript:` and is inert, and a substring assertion there
fails for the wrong reason and teaches you to loosen it.

### 2 · Conditional pages, sized by the same function the block uses

The block renders the whole source, packs the resulting blocks into buckets of
`linesPerPage` and emits bucket `pageIndex`. A master declares one answer page
plus seven continuations, each conditional on `qa.answerPages > N`, and a
conditional page that does not render costs nothing because `visiblePages`
filters before layout. A median answer therefore produces a five-page document
and the longest produces twelve, from one set of masters — the Client Details
Form pattern.

`packMarkdownPages` lives in `reports/markdownPaging.pure.ts` because the
projection and the block both need it and **must not disagree**: the master makes
page N conditional while the block decides what page N holds, and a drift of one
line prints a blank page or loses the end of an answer. `reportQaOnTheFamilies.spec.ts`
asserts the composer's lines-per-page equals the module's.

Packing never splits a Markdown block, so a table taller than a page keeps its
header instead of reading as two unlabelled tables.

### What the masters draw, and what stays here

**One exchange in depth** — the question, its answer, the sources it was grounded
in, and a list of what else was asked. That is the document a fixed page sequence
suits.

A whole transcript is not: conversations reach 70 turns, and
`render-report-qa-pdf` paginates one properly. It remains the default, and the
adapter's `legacyFallback` says so rather than implying the template replaces it.

`reportQaOnTheFamilies.spec.ts` replaces `reportQaNotOnTheFamilies.spec.ts` and
keeps its central assertion — that **`text-block` still escapes**. The fix was to
add a block that renders safely, not to relax the one that escapes.
