/**
 * Generate `supabase/migration-object-index.json` — every database object this
 * repository's migrations have ever CREATED, and every one they have DROPPED.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * A workspace provisioned from this repository is brought up by catalog
 * introspection, which creates and never drops. So an object this repository
 * DELETES survives on every existing tenant for ever, and every parity stage
 * reconciles on `clone >= prime` — containment, not equality — and reads that
 * as matching. Measured on one tenant, 3 Sep 2026: `public.builder_design_images`,
 * present there and in no schema of this project, against a tables stage
 * reporting reconciled.
 *
 * Naming that drift was the easy half. The hard half was that nobody could act
 * on it: a surplus object is either **this repository's leftover** or **the
 * tenant's own**, dropping the first is tidying and dropping the second
 * destroys their data, and the tenant's live schema cannot tell you which —
 * both are simply "a table that is here and not there".
 *
 * This repository's own history can. If these migrations created an object,
 * it was ours; if they never mention it, it never was. That is the same rule
 * the file cascade already applies — a path is removed only where this
 * repository's history shows it deleted — expressed for the database.
 *
 * ## What it is NOT
 *
 * It is not permission to drop anything, and nothing downstream drops on it.
 * It converts one unanswerable question ("537 tables against 536 — decide")
 * into a list of named objects each carrying the evidence for what it is.
 *
 * ## Reading the output
 *
 * `created` and `dropped` are `"<class>:<qualified name>"`, lowercased, quotes
 * stripped. A name is recorded from the statement's text alone — no SQL is
 * executed and no schema is consulted — so the index is a claim about this
 * repository's history and nothing else.
 *
 * Two deliberate imprecisions, both erring the same way:
 *
 *   * An unqualified name (`create table foo`) is stored unqualified. A
 *     consumer matches on the bare name as well as the qualified one, because
 *     the alternative is assuming `public` and being wrong about a schema.
 *   * A name that appears only in a comment or a string still counts as
 *     created. That pushes an object toward "ours", which is the side that
 *     gets REVIEWED rather than the side that gets dropped.
 *
 * Regenerate with `npm run migrations:index`; `npm run migrations:index:check`
 * fails when the committed file is stale. Never hand-edit it.
