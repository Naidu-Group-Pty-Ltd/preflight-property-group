/**
 * A migration must run AFTER the objects it needs exist.
 *
 * The analysis is `scripts/lib/migrationDependencyOrder.mjs`; this is the gate
 * around it. It is a RATCHET rather than a ban: what this corpus already
 * carries is frozen in `MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY_ORDER.json` and anything new
 * fails.
 *
 * The frozen set is an inventory, not permission. It is keyed by
 * `file|object|form` rather than by line, so moving a statement does not
 * churn it, and a frozen finding that stops firing fails too — a ratchet that
 * cannot tighten is a list that only grows.
 *
 * Run `--update` to rewrite the baseline, and say in the commit why the number
 * moved.
