/**
 * WP-24 — the four items that were already closed, and had nothing holding them.
 *
 * The 20-item review found items 6, 8, 9 and 13 in good shape and gated by
 * nothing. That is a specific and quiet kind of risk: a property that is true
 * because of how somebody wrote the code once, with no mechanism to notice when
 * the next person writes it differently. Every other item on that list has a
 * gate; these four had the reviewer's word.
 *
 * Each rule below asserts a property the codebase ALREADY satisfies, so this
 * fails only on a regression.
 *
 *   item 6  — no arbitrary-SQL execution path
 *   item 8  — user HTML is sanitised before it is injected
 *   item 9  — passwords are hashed, never stored or compared as plaintext
 *   item 13 — every portal keeps an email-verification flow

// forwards a caller's string to one, would undo that in a single commit and
// look like a convenience while doing it.

  // current_password` in three change-password functions, which is a
  // don't-reuse-your-old-password check over two values the user just typed and
  // has nothing to do with storage. A gate that cries wolf about correct code is
  // how gates get ignored, so this now requires one side to be a record field.
  //
  // Same reason for TYPEOF_GUARD. `typeof row.password_hash === 'string'` is a
  // presence check — "does this partner have a credential at all" — and the
  // right-hand side is a type name, never a submitted secret. It read as a
  // violation for as long as `partnerAccess.pure.ts` has existed, which is long
  // enough that the whole security job was failing on it. Neutralise the shape
  // before testing rather than relax the rule: a real comparison is not written

  // the negative-test mutation (`body.pw === user.password_hash`) still trips it.
