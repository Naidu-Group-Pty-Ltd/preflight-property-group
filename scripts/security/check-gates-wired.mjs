/**
 * Every security gate must actually run somewhere.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `scripts/security/` had grown to 47 gates. Twelve of them were referenced by
 * nothing — not `ci.yml`, not `package.json`, not another script. They had been
 * written, reviewed and merged, and then never executed again.
 *
 * That is worse than not having written them. A gate nobody runs still reads as
 * coverage: the file exists, the concern looks handled, and the next person
 * greps for "cors" or "authz", finds a check, and moves on. Meanwhile the thing
 * it guards drifts freely.
 *
 * When they were finally run by hand, four failed — and two of those four were
 * live defects rather than gate drift:
 *
 *   - three push endpoints answered `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` while
 *     being called with credentials, which the browser rejects outright, so
 *     every call had been failing as an opaque "Failed to fetch";
 *   - `solicitor-portal-intelligence` resolved matter access without also
 *     resolving the per-client permission matrix, leaving the legacy
 *     `SOLICITOR_MATTER_ACCESS_V1=false` path able to return a whole portfolio
 *     to a solicitor denied `matters.view`.
 *
 * Neither would have survived a single CI run. Both survived months.
 *
 * ## What this checks
 *
 * Every `scripts/security/check-*.mjs`, plus the per-portal security checks,
 * must be named by a GitHub workflow or by a `package.json` script that a
 * workflow runs. Naming it in `package.json` alone is not enough — an npm
 * script nobody invokes is exactly the failure mode above — so the reachable
 * set is computed transitively from the workflows.
 *
 * A gate that is deliberately not wired (a one-off forensic tool, say) belongs
 * in UNWIRED_BY_DESIGN below, with a reason. An empty list is the goal.
