/**
 * An Edge Function may not name a column its table does not have.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * PostgREST answers `42703` for a column that does not exist. Almost every call
 * site in this repository destructures `{ data }` and throws the `error` away,
 * so a mistyped column does not read as an error — it reads as **no rows**. A
 * table without the column and a row without a value answer identically, which
 * is why this class survives review, survives testing against an empty
 * database, and is only ever found by reading the schema.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` already records what one instance cost: eighteen call sites named
 * `aml.cases.tenant_id`, a column that table has never had, and twelve handlers
 * then reported "Case not found" about a case the operator had open.
 *
 * A sweep for the same shape across `supabase/functions/` found **fifty-eight
 * more**, in eighteen functions. Among them:
 *
 *   - `secure-storage` selected `investment_reports.client_id, created_by`
 *     (they are `client_property_id` and `generated_by`), so every human upload
 *     to that bucket was refused 403 — which reached an adviser as
 *     "PDF generation failed. Please try again.";
 *   - `dispatch-marketing-reports` selected a contact name and email off
 *     `ghl_client_opportunities`, which has neither, so the scheduled dispatch
 *     resolved no recipients at all;
 *   - `market-updates-embed-backfill` selected `market_updates.summary`
 *     (it is `ai_summary`), so it had never embedded a single update;
 *   - `agent-insights-runner` filtered `client_deals.assigned_user_id`, which
 *     does not exist, so no stale-deal or settlement insight was ever raised;
 *   - three authorisation fallbacks read `custom_users.role_display` (it is
 *     `role`) and therefore could never grant.
 *
 * Every one of those reported as normal, empty operation.
 *
 * ## What this checks
 *
 * Literal column lists only — `.select('a, b')`, and `.insert(…)` /
 * `.update(…)` / `.upsert(…)` whose payload is an object LITERAL. An
 * interpolated select or an embedded resource (`a, b(c)`) is not a set of
 * names this can read, and is skipped rather than guessed at.
 *
 * ## Two shapes it used to miss, and what they cost
 *
 * Both were found on 13 Sep 2026, in the CRM's outbound message path, and both
 * were FATAL rather than silent — `ghl_conversation_messages` has no
 * `message_type` column in the table, in any migration, or in the generated
 * types, and PostgREST answers a write naming one with PGRST204.
 *
 *   A LITERAL WITH AN INTERPOLATION IN IT. The write body was matched with
 *   `[^{}]*`, so a payload containing a template literal — `\`failed-${key}\`` —
 *   or any nested object failed to match at all and was never judged. The
 *   object is now brace-matched and only TOP-LEVEL keys are taken, which is
 *   what makes a nested `metadata: { … }` safe to skip rather than fatal to
 *   parse.
 *
 *   A LITERAL BOUND TO A CONST. `const messageRecord = { … }` passed to
 *   `.upsert(messageRecord)` was skipped under the old rule that "a payload
 *   assembled in a variable is not a set of names anything can read". A `const`
 *   whose initialiser is an object literal IS readable, and that is the shape
 *   that returned HTTP 500 on every outbound SMS the product ever sent — after
 *   GoHighLevel had already delivered the message. The rule is sharpened
 *   rather than dropped: a literal is judged wherever it is written, and
 *   anything genuinely dynamic (a spread, a computed key, an identifier with
 *   no literal initialiser, one assigned more than once) is still skipped.
 *
 * ## What it still cannot see
 *
 * The columns are the generated types UNION the migrations, which
 * over-approximates on purpose so a column added since the types were last
 * regenerated is not reported as missing. That union is why this check passed
 * over `available_channels` for two months: a committed migration declared it
 * and **that migration had never been applied to any database in the fleet**
 * (Mission Control's `schema_migration_queue` was built on 28 Aug 2026 and its
 * oldest entry is `20260828020000`, so nothing committed before that date was
 * ever enqueued). A column named by a migration is not a column the database
 * has.
 *
 * That class deliberately has NO gate here, and the reason is measured rather
 * than assumed: reporting every column the migrations declare and the
 * generated types do not finds 95 across 47 tables, and almost all of them are
 * columns production really has and `types.ts` is simply stale about — the
 * lib's own header names `builder_stock_items.image_work_stage` as exactly
 * that. The two cases are indistinguishable without asking a database, so a
 * gate here would be noise. Compare the repo's migrations against
 * `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` on the project itself; that is a
 * deploy-time question, not a source-tree one.
 *
 * Columns are resolved by `lib/supabaseSchema.mjs` as the UNION of the
 * generated types and the migrations, so a column added since the types were
 * last regenerated is not reported as missing.
 *
 * A table neither source has heard of is skipped: it may be a view, another
 * schema, or a table this repository does not define.
