/**
 * WP-17 — the database layer has to hold its own hardening.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `docs/security/REMEDIATION_FINAL_STATUS_2026-07-21.md` closed the backend
 * remediation with three numbers:
 *
 *     security_definer_view                        3 -> 0
 *     *_security_definer_function_executable     116 -> 9
 *     function_search_path_mutable                 8 -> 0
 *
 * Three weeks later the live advisor read **2 / 96 / 5**.
 *
 * Nothing undid those fixes. They were one-off migrations rather than
 * invariants, and 323 migrations landed after them — 136 creating or altering
 * SECURITY DEFINER objects. Postgres grants EXECUTE to PUBLIC at CREATE time and
 * `anon` inherits PUBLIC, so every new SECURITY DEFINER function starts
 * reachable by the publishable key that ships in the browser bundle, and every
 * new view starts reading its base tables with the owner's rights. Nothing in
 * `.github/workflows/` reads `supabase/migrations/**` at all, so the decay was
 * invisible between advisor runs.
 *
 * Every other layer here has a gate. This is the database's.
 *
 * ## Rules
 *
 *   secdef_search_path    CREATE FUNCTION ... SECURITY DEFINER must SET search_path.
 *   secdef_execute        A new SECURITY DEFINER function must REVOKE EXECUTE
 *                         from PUBLIC (revoking from `anon` alone is a no-op —
 *                         that was the RLS-W5 lesson, 20260725096000).
 *   view_security_invoker CREATE VIEW must set security_invoker = true.
 *   table_rls             CREATE TABLE in public/aml must ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY.
 *
 * ## Grandfathering
 *
 * Only migrations at or after BASELINE are checked, the same ratchet
 * `edge-typecheck-baseline.json` and `needs-review-baseline.json` use. The
 * existing corpus is 900+ files and belongs to other programmes; WP-17's own
 * sweep migration cleans up what it left behind. New debt cannot land.
 *
 * Exemptions live in supabase/migrations/MIGRATION_SECURITY_KEEPLIST.json, keyed
 * by OBJECT and never by file — exempting a file exempts everything anyone adds
 * to it later.

/**
 * Tables whose RLS is enabled by DYNAMIC DDL, which the literal scan cannot see.

 * loop:
 *
 *     DO $$ DECLARE t text; BEGIN
 *       FOREACH t IN ARRAY ARRAY['a','b','c','d'] LOOP
 *         EXECUTE format('ALTER TABLE public.%I ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY', t);
 *         ...
 *       END LOOP;
 *     END $$;
 *
 * The literal regex below cannot read that, and it failed in the worst possible
 * way: it looks for the table name within 120 characters of
 * `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, so the two tables named EARLY in the array
 * matched — by accident, against the array literal rather than against any
 * statement — and the two named late did not. Half a file passing for a reason
 * unrelated to what it is checking is worse than the file failing.
 *
 * That is what `20260915000000_builder_stock_list_marketplace.sql` hit. It
 * enables RLS on all four of its tables, adds a service-role-only policy to
 * each, and revokes every grant from `anon` and `authenticated` — verified
 * against production, where all four carry `relrowsecurity = true`, one policy,
 * and no grant for either role. The gate reported two of them as unprotected
 * and turned the `security` job red for every branch.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. Only a literal `ARRAY[...]` of quoted names inside a
 * block that dynamically enables RLS counts. A name built at runtime, read from
 * a catalog query, or passed in as a parameter is still unreadable, and the
 * table still has to be enabled literally — which is the right answer, because
 * a gate cannot verify what it cannot enumerate.
