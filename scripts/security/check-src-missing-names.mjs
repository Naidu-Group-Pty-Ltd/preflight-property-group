/**
 * Undefined identifiers in the app bundle — fatal, never baselined.
 *
 * This is the browser-side twin of the TS2304/TS2552 rule
 * `check-edge-functions.mjs` already enforces over Edge Functions, and it
 * exists for the same reason, learned the same way.
 *
 * ## Why the build does not already catch this
 *
 * `npm run build` is Vite. Vite STRIPS types; it does not check them. A name
 * that does not exist is therefore not a build failure — it is a
 * successfully-bundled `ReferenceError` waiting for the line to run. The
 * repository has no `tsc` gate over `src/` at all: `tsconfig.json` declares
 * `"files": []` and delegates to project references, so `tsc --noEmit -p
 * tsconfig.json` (the obvious spelling) compiles NOTHING and exits 0 while
 * `tsconfig.app.json` holds the real error.
 *
 * ## Why this class and no other
 *
 * `src/` carries pre-existing type errors — 17 of them the day this gate was
 * written — and none is worth blocking a release over: a wrong `LegacyRef`
 * variance renders exactly the same pixels. An undefined identifier is a
 * different kind of thing. It is not a mistyped contract, it is a line that
 * cannot execute, and the component containing it throws on render.
 *
 * ## Why it is here
 *
 * It happened. `PortalAgreementConsent` declared `beforeAccept` in its props
 * TYPE and rendered `{beforeAccept}` in its JSX, and the prop was never added
 * to the destructured parameter list. TypeScript was right about the props;
 * the identifier simply did not exist. Lint passed, the build passed, and
 * every guard over that surface reads source rather than mounting it — so the
 * first thing that noticed was a partner outside every portal, opening an
 * emailed compliance agreement and being shown "Something went wrong" by the
 * top-level error boundary, with no account, no support channel and no way to
 * tell a broken page from a bad link.
 *
 * ## The ratchet
 *
 * `src-missing-names.txt` freezes occurrences that already existed, keyed by
 * FILE and IDENTIFIER rather than by line — a line number moves with every
 * edit above it, so a positional key would either churn or silently start
 * covering a different defect. It is EMPTY at the time of writing, which is
 * the whole point: there is no debt to grandfather, so nothing new may land.

/*
 * `tsc` over this project peaks at ~3.2 GB, measured. Node's default old-space
 * ceiling is smaller than that on a GitHub runner, so the child died with
 * "Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit" after 93 seconds and this gate
 * reported, correctly, that it "did not run". Every pull request in the
 * repository failed `verify` on it.
 *
 * The honest failure is what made it findable — a gate that cannot run must
 * never report a pass — so that branch below is untouched and only the heap
 * moves. 6 GB against a measured 3.2 GB peak leaves room for the project to
 * grow before this is a question again; the runner has 16 GB.
 *
 * An existing NODE_OPTIONS is preserved rather than replaced: it may carry
 * something the caller needs, and appending keeps the last --max-old-space-size
 * winning if one is already set.
