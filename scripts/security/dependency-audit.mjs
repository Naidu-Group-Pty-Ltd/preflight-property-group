/**
 * Dependency vulnerability gate (SUPPLY-001 / CI-001).
 *
 * Runs `npm audit --json` and fails the build when a vulnerability at or above
 * the blocking severity is present and not explicitly accepted.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - Blocks on `high` by default (override with SECURITY_AUDIT_LEVEL:
 *    low|moderate|high|critical). Findings below the threshold are reported as
 *    warnings so they stay visible without breaking every unrelated PR.
 *  - Accepted advisories are listed in
 *    scripts/security/dependency-audit-allowlist.json (by advisory URL or
 *    GHSA/CVE id, each with a reason + review date). Anything not on the
 *    allowlist counts toward the gate.
 *  - `npm audit` exits non-zero when it finds anything; we capture output and
 *    make our own pass/fail decision, so a clean-but-nonzero exit is fine.
 *
 * This is intentionally advisory-database driven (npm's registry mirrors the
 * GitHub Advisory / OSV data), so it needs no extra service. SBOM generation
 * is handled separately in CI via @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm.

/**
 * Is this package accepted?
 *
 * Directly, when one of its own advisory ids is on the allowlist. Or
 * TRANSITIVELY: `npm audit` also flags a package whose only fault is depending
 * on a vulnerable one, and represents that as a `via` entry which is a bare
 * package NAME rather than an advisory object. `pptxgenjs` is flagged solely
 * because it pulls in `image-size`; it has no advisory of its own, so there is
 * no id to allowlist and no way to accept it without naming the bare package —
 * which the allowlist's own policy forbids, because accepting a package accepts
 * every future advisory against it sight unseen.
 *
 * So a package flagged only through other packages is accepted exactly when all
 * of those are. The judgement stays attached to the advisory that was actually
 * read, and a NEW advisory against `pptxgenjs` itself would arrive as an
 * advisory object and block, as it should.
 *
 * ## The `seen` set is per-PATH, not per-traversal
 *
 * `seen` guards against a cycle, and a cycle is a repeat along ONE path. Sharing
 * a single set across the sibling branches of `.every` also rejects a **diamond**
 * — a package legitimately reached twice by two different routes — because the
 * second visit looks like a repeat.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. It blocked `main`:
 *
 *     radix-ui ─┬─ @radix-ui/react-form ── @radix-ui/react-label ── image-size
 *               └─ @radix-ui/react-label ─────────────────────────── image-size
 *
 * `image-size`'s two advisories are on the allowlist with reasons and a review
 * date, and both radix packages were reported `accepted-via-allowlist`. But
 * evaluating `react-form` first put `react-label` in the shared set, so the
 * second branch returned false, `.every` failed, and `radix-ui [high]` was
 * reported as an unaccepted advisory that nobody could act on — there is no
 * advisory id to allowlist, and naming the bare package is what the allowlist's
 * own policy forbids.
 *
 * A fresh copy per branch keeps the guard doing what it is for.
