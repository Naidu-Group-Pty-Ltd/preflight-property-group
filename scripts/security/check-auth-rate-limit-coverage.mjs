/**
 * Auth / password-recovery rate-limit coverage gate.
 *
 * Three properties, each of which was actually violated before this landed:
 *
 * 1. **Every credential-accepting endpoint consumes a source-keyed ceiling.**
 *    Per-account lockouts (5 failures → 15 minutes) were the only control on
 *    most of these, and a per-account counter cannot see a spray: one attempt
 *    against each of ten thousand accounts never reaches attempt two on any of
 *    them. `custom-auth-login-v2` — the staff login — had no source ceiling at
 *    all, nor did the client and finance portal logins, nor any of the
 *    reset-password handlers.
 *
 * 2. **No auth endpoint keys a limiter on `X-Forwarded-For`.** A client sets
 *    that header and intermediaries append rather than replace, so element [0]
 *    is attacker-chosen. Six handlers bucketed on it, which means they read as
 *    rate-limited in review and enforced nothing. `getTrustedClientIp` exists
 *    precisely because of this and is the only sanctioned source.
 *
 * 3. **The IP dimension is consumed before any identifier-keyed bucket.**
 *    Otherwise a caller already over their IP ceiling can still mint persistent
 *    limiter rows for every e-mail address they care to invent (ABUSE-003).
 *    `beginAuthRateLimit` makes this structural by only exposing
 *    `consumeIdentifier` through the gate the IP check returns, so this asserts
 *    handlers use that shape rather than hand-rolling the ordering.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/security/check-auth-rate-limit-coverage.mjs
