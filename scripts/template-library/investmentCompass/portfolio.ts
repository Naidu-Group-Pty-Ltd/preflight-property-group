/**
 * The Portfolio Performance Review, drawn in the ten Investment Compass families.
 *
 * The third report format on the family system, after Investment Compass and
 * the Borrowing Capacity Snapshot. It shares `master.ts` with both and
 * contributes only its own page sequence — see
 * `docs/template-library/07-investment-compass-families.md`.
 *
 * ## The inventory is bounded on purpose
 *
 * `docs/reports/PORTFOLIO.md` opens on four findings against the shipping
 * generator, and two of them are about this page model failing to hold a
 * portfolio: **F1**, a contents page whose numbers go out of true the moment a
 * table spills; and **F4**, an inventory that silently drops rows because the
 * continuation index is computed at a row height of 20 while the table was
 * drawn at 22, "and the rows in between are never printed… a portfolio needing
 * a third page loses everything past the second, with nothing on the page
 * saying so".
 *
 * This template model cannot paginate at all — blocks are absolutely positioned
 * and nothing reflows — so it must not pretend to. The inventory is drawn at
 * **three depths under mutually exclusive conditionals** up to the observed
 * maximum of four rows (`total_properties` runs 1–4 across all 21 stored
 * reports), and the page says what it is showing when a portfolio exceeds the
 * deepest. Silently truncating a fifth property would reproduce F4 in a new
 * generator, which is the one outcome this migration exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## The legacy document's sections, as conditional pages
 *
 * Everything `buildPortfolioReview` composes now has a page, in the legacy
 * spine's own order, each conditional on the projection having published its
 * namespace: composition, the per-property verdicts (the ranking beside the
 * review's own scoring), capacity utilisation, market conditions, the
 * ten-year projection and its assumptions, the four growth avenues, the
 * review wizard's scenarios and the review record itself. Presence across
 * the 21 stored reports runs from 9 (market, capacity) to 21 (composition,
 * growth, verdicts, projection), so the common render is most of the
 * document rather than a stub. Sections the fixed-page model cannot hold in
 * full are excerpted with the omission said on the page — two options per
 * growth avenue, the first outlook — and the merged action plan is published
 * (`portfolio.actionPlan`) but deliberately unbound: twenty-one rows of
 * 345-character titles measured out at over two pages, and an excerpt of a
 * priority-ordered list would silently drop the review's own entries.
 *
 * ## Prose is bound only where the leaf is a string
 *
 * `analysis.executiveSummary` and `strategicRecommendations` are **objects**,
 * not paragraphs. The projection only publishes leaves that are genuinely
 * strings, so nothing here can reach a page as `[object Object]`.
 *
 * ## Conditionals are JavaScript, not binding paths
 *
 * `{{portfolio.growth.groups.0.items.0}}` is a binding; a page conditional is
 * an expression, and `groups.0.items` is a **syntax error** there — the eval
 * fails, the guard logs and answers false, and the page is silently dark on
 * every render. Every numeric segment in a conditional below is bracketed
 * (`groups[0].items.length`), and the catalogue spec evaluates each one.
