/**
 * The Property Comparison Analysis, drawn in the ten Investment Compass families.
 *
 * The fourth report format on the family system. It shares `master.ts` with the
 * other three and contributes only its own page sequence — see
 * `docs/template-library/07-investment-compass-families.md`.
 *
 * ## This format compares 2 to 5 properties, and the count is not a constant
 *
 * Every other format on this system draws a fixed thing. This one draws a
 * ranking whose length is the comparison's own: 7 of the 50 stored rows compare
 * two properties, 17 compare three, 9 compare four and 17 compare five.
 *
 * A five-row table would print three empty rows on the two-property
 * comparisons, which reads as a document that failed to finish. A two-row table
 * would silently drop three properties, which is `PORTFOLIO.md`'s F4 in a new
 * format. So the ranking is drawn **four times, once per count, each carrying a
 * conditional, all at the same position** — one renders and the rest do not
 * exist. See `FlowItem.block` in `blocks.ts`.
 *
 * The same shape applies to the risk register, the investor matches and the red
 * flags: one block per property, each conditional on that property existing.
 * Those cost their height whether or not they render, which is the price of a
 * conditional in a layout that cannot reflow.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is a figure
 *
 * A comparison carries no deterministic numbers at all — every field was
 * written by a model in one response. The single number, `finalScore`, is on
 * **two scales** across the table, so it is never printed without its
 * denominator beside it. `comparisonProjection.pure.ts` records the rest.
