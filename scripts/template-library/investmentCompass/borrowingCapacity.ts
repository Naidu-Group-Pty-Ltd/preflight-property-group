/**
 * The Borrowing Capacity Snapshot, drawn in the ten Investment Compass families.
 *
 * ## Why a second composer rather than a parameter on the first
 *
 * The family system is format-agnostic by construction — typography, density,
 * margins, KPI arrangement, table treatment and colourway carry no subject
 * matter — so all ten designs serve this format unchanged, and `master.ts`
 * compiles both catalogues through one shell. What is *not* shared is the
 * document: an Investment Compass report argues about a property and ends on a
 * ten-year projection; a Snapshot argues about a household's income and ends on
 * what a lender would advance against it. Bending one page sequence to cover
 * both with conditionals would produce a template that is neither.
 *
 * ## The pages
 *
 * Follows the structure `docs/reports/BORROWING_CAPACITY.md` records for the
 * shipping generator, minus the pages whose data does not exist:
 *
 *  | Snapshot page                    | Here                                  |
 *  |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
 *  | Cover                            | Cover                                 |
 *  | Summary, KPIs, assumptions, LMI  | Capacity summary (+ conditional LMI)  |
 *  | Income analysis                  | Income analysis                       |
 *  | Expenses & liabilities           | Commitments                           |
 *  | Capacity breakdown, warnings     | Serviceability, recommendations       |
 *  | Executive summary                | The assessment (narrative)            |
 *  | Assessment ledger                | How the assessment reads              |
 *  | Assumptions                      | What was assumed                      |
 *  | How this was calculated          | conditional — column null on old rows |
 *  | Audit trail                      | conditional — column null on old rows |
 *  | Scenarios                        | conditional — no stored producer      |
 *  | Closing                          | Important information                 |
 *
 * `explanation` and `audit_trail` are columns the calculator now writes, null
 * on every row stored before its keep-update landed — so those pages render
 * nothing today and light up per row as new runs land, with no template
 * change. Scenario presets never reach a column at all (they only travel in a
 * render request), so that page stays dark by construction. The audit table is
 * capped at the projection's fourteen rows with a whole-sentence omission note
 * beyond that, which is what makes a fixed-position page safe against an
 * unbounded trail.
 *
 * ## Bindings
 *
 * Every figure binds the vocabulary `borrowingCapacityProjection.pure.ts`
 * publishes, which is itself read off the live table. Nothing here binds a
 * column name directly: the projection is the contract, and it is what keeps
 * `capacity.dti` a multiple rather than the percentage a reader would assume
 * from the column name.

  // plus one for a non-default lender policy and one for LMI — eight to ten,
  // never fewer. Ten three-line definitions do not fit one page, so the legacy

  // page conditional on there being a rest. The headline goes in an 'In short'
  // callout exactly as the legacy render sets it — at heading size its ~80
  // characters would wrap to three display lines on the tighter families.
  //
  // The continuation page draws its list three times at one position under
  // mutually exclusive step-count conditionals (8, 9, 10), the assumptions
  // table's own pattern — a definition row whose bindings resolve empty still
  // prints its ruled band, so a fixed ten-row list would rule off two empty
  // rows on the commonest report.
