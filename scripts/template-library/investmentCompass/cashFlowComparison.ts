/**
 * The Cash Flow Comparison Analysis, drawn in the ten Investment Compass families.
 *
 * The seventh report format on the family system, and the first that is
 * **preview-only**. It shares `master.ts` with the other six and contributes
 * only its own page sequence — see
 * `docs/template-library/07-investment-compass-families.md`.
 *
 * ## Why there is no adapter, stated once
 *
 * `cashFlowComparisonProjection.pure.ts` carries it in full. The short version:
 * the projections are the browser's and are never persisted; the analysis is
 * never persisted and structurally cannot be (`cash_flow_analyses` holds 0 rows
 * and its INSERT policy refuses this application's own sign-in); and the render
 * ledger — filling now, one succeeded render as of August 2026 — stores
 * neither payload, and is superadmin-only. The stored
 * `financial_calculations.projections` cannot substitute, because every
 * headline measure in this document is built on `afterTaxAnnual` and that
 * series models no tax at all.
 *
 * So these fifty are browsable, previewable and copyable, and they become
 * activatable the day a comparison is persisted somewhere a template can reach
 * — no change to this file, only an adapter calling the projection.
 *
 * ## The document's shape changes with the property count, and that is drawn
 *
 * A comparison holds **2 to 5 properties**, and this format's central tables put
 * one column per property. A five-column table on a two-property comparison
 * prints three empty columns, which reads as a document that failed to finish;
 * a two-column one silently loses three properties.
 *
 * So every property-wide table is drawn **four times, once per count, each under
 * a conditional, all at the same `y`** — the pattern the Property Comparison
 * introduced for its ranking, generalised here into `byPropertyCount()` because
 * this format needs it on five tables rather than one. Exactly one renders.
 *
 * ## What the contract forbids, and these pages honour
 *
 *  - **Model prose names no property.** `propertyNumber` indexes an ordering
 *    that existed inside one function call and was never recorded, so every
 *    model sentence prints unattributed. Rankings are the exception, matched on
 *    an address the model was told to echo — and one that matched nothing says
 *    so on the row.
 *  - **`avoid` is on the risk page, never the ranking page.** Naming a property
 *    to avoid beside the ranking, in a document an adviser may hand to a client
 *    considering that property, is a different act from ranking it last.
 *  - **`highestRisk` stays prose**, never a scoreboard row: an award for being
 *    the worst is not a category anyone wins.
 *  - **The verdict leads with the gap**, not the winner's figure. A 40% lead is
 *    a decision and a 2% lead is a coin toss, and a ranked list says neither.
 *  - **Both break-evens are printed, named apart**, with a note saying which is
 *    which: the modal's is the year cumulative cash flow turns non-negative and
 *    the 10 Year Cash Flow's is the year annual does. They are rarely the same
 *    year and neither screen could see the other.
 *
 * ## The analysis pages are independently conditional
 *
 * `compare-cash-flow-reports` asks for eight sections with `maxTokens: 4000`,
 * and a response that closed its braces early still parses — so a partial
 * analysis is a normal arrival rather than a fault. Each analysis page is gated
 * on its own block; gating them together would drop three present sections
 * because a fourth ran out of budget. A comparison with no analysis at all is a
 * complete, sendable document, and the closing page says so rather than leaving
 * the absence to be noticed.
