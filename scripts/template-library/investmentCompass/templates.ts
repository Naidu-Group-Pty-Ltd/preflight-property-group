/**
 * The fifty approved Investment Compass masters.
 *
 * ## One composition, fifty manifests
 *
 * The approved catalogue marks archetype coverage `BUILT` for each family's
 * reference and `MANIFEST` for the other four, and says so in as many words:
 * "This is the family reference. The other four variants are expressed as
 * overrides on it." So there is one composition here, parameterised by the
 * resolved manifest, rather than fifty hand-drawn documents.
 *
 * That is not a shortcut — it is the property the catalogue is built on. An
 * eleventh family is a declaration in `source.json`; a sixth variant is an
 * override object; and a change to how a section opener is drawn reaches all
 * fifty at once. What makes the fifty *different* is the manifest: 31 KPI
 * layouts, 30 chart styles, 29 cover overlays, 27 section headers and 26 table
 * treatments, each resolved to a primitive by `resolvers.ts`.
 *
 * ## The seven archetypes
 *
 * Every master covers `ARCHETYPES` in order: Cover, Executive dashboard,
 * Narrative, Dense data, Chart and scenario, Risk and recommendation, Sources
 * and appendix. A spacious template spends more pages on the same material —
 * that is what `density: spacious` means — so page count varies by variant
 * while archetype coverage does not.
 *
 * ## Bindings
 *
 * Every value a report supplies is a `{{binding}}` against the production
 * Investment Report namespaces. Risk ratings are literal, following the
 * convention the existing catalogue already sets: the investment adapter emits
 * no rating field, and binding one would print an empty column on every real
 * report.

 * This table was eight fixed rows, and on the report behind this change —
 * `1be16c4a`, 93 Bimbadeen Avenue, 15 Aug 2026 — six of them printed as a
 * ruled, striped, labelled row with nothing in the Detail column. That is not
 * that record's misfortune. Counted across the whole `investment_reports`
 * table on 2026-08-16, after `projectInvestmentReport` was taught the finance
 * run's spellings:
 *
 * | row | resolves on | of 1,187 |
 * | --- | ---: | --- |
 * | Address | 1,187 | `property_address`, never null |
 * | Property type | 1,059 | + 34 more from `propertySpecs.propertyType` |
 * | Configuration | 656 | bedrooms 651, bathrooms 633, parking 34 |
 * | Land area | 114 | `propertySpecs.landSizeSqm`; `land_size_sqm` is null on **every** row |
 * | Building area | 114 | `propertySpecs.buildSizeSqm` — note the spelling |
 * | Year built | **0** | the key exists on 1,059 rows and holds null on all of them |
 * | Zoning | **0** | as above |
 * | Council | **0** | as above |
 *
 * So three of the eight could not print on any report ever generated, and two
 * more printed on one report in ten. The rows stay in the master rather than
 * being deleted: the columns exist, an intake that starts filling them fills
 * this page with no template change, and the guard costs a boolean.
 *
 * The unit belongs to the row and not to the projection — `landArea` is a
 * number so that a KPI or a chart can use it — and it is safe to write beside
 * the binding only because the row no longer prints without a value. An
 * unresolved binding renders as the empty string, so a fixed row would have
 * printed a bare " m²".

   * What the purchase costs, and what of it is cash.
   *
   * ## "Total acquisition cost / Sum of the above" was two false claims
   *
   * The figure is `initialCosts.totalUpfront` — $340,287 on the report behind
   * this change — printed under rows that add to $1,460,587, because the
   * purchase price is in the same column and is not a cash cost. A reader
   * checking the arithmetic finds it wrong by a factor of four, and the one
   * they are most likely to act on is the one at the bottom in bold.
   *
   * It is not the sum of anything, either. Measured over the 167 stored runs
   * that carry the block, `totalUpfront` equals deposit + duty + legal +
   * inspection + LMI on **29** of them; the average gap is $454 and the largest
   * is $93,000. So no basis of the form "sum of …" is true of this figure, and
   * `totals: [last]` — a doubled rule, which is the accounting convention for
   * "the numbers above add up to this" — was itself the claim.
   *
   * Three changes, all of them removing an assertion rather than adding one:
   * the row says what the figure is (`Total upfront cash`), the basis says
   * where it comes from rather than how it was reached, and the doubled rule is
   * gone. The deposit is shown because it is the largest part of that cash and
   * the projection publishes it (`initialCosts.deposit`) — its absence is what
   * made the total look unrelated to the page.

  // ── 06b The report itself ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // Everything above this point is drawn from the calculator's jsonb columns —
  // `investment_score`, `financial_calculations`, `property_specs`. None of it
  // is the report. The report is `report_content`: the document the model
  // writes against the configured `report_structure_templates` guide, and what
  // an operator means by "the report structure".
  //
  // Until now no master carried a word of it. `{{sections.*}}` was bound by 0
  // of the 13 active `report_templates` rows, and the projection published
  // nothing from `report_content` at all — so choosing a template produced a
  // scorecard on a fixed page sequence and the report was simply absent.
  //
  // Measured 2026-08-16 across the 1,183 stored bodies:
  //
  //   tier        reports   median lines   longest
  //   compass       1,120        423        3,192
  //   strategic         9      1,166        1,322
  //   financial         9        785          906
  //   briefing         21        298          968
  //   snapshot         24         71          157
  //
  // No fixed sequence covers that range, which is exactly the case conditional
  // pages exist for: `NARRATIVE_PAGES` continuations, each holding one bucket
  // of the same source, each conditional on the bucket existing. A page that
  // does not render costs nothing — `visiblePages` filters before layout — so a
  // snapshot produces two pages here and a compass a dozen, from one master.
  //
  // The page count comes from the projection, computed with the same
  // `packMarkdownPages` the block uses. See `reports/markdownPaging.pure.ts`
  // for why that has to be one function rather than two.
  // 40, not 24. The allowance is a page budget, and it was set from the compass
  // median; a strategic report's median body is ~38 pages, so at 24 the format
  // whose document is longest was the one most often clipped. 40 covers the
  // median of every tier. A page that is not needed costs nothing — the
  // conditional filters it before layout — so the only price of a generous
  // allowance is schema size, and the only price of a mean one is a client
  // reading half a report.
