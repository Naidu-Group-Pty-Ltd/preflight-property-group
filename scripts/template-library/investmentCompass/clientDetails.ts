/**
 * The Client Details Form, drawn in the ten Investment Compass families.
 *
 * The sixth report format on the family system. It shares `master.ts` with the
 * other five and contributes only its own page sequence — see
 * `docs/template-library/07-investment-compass-families.md`.
 *
 * ## 96% of these documents are about a client with nothing recorded
 *
 * Measured across all 775 clients: **742 have no property, no employment, no
 * asset, no liability and no expense.** That is not an edge case to guard
 * against, it is the document. `docs/reports/CLIENT_DETAILS.md` records what the
 * shipping generator does with it — opens on a Properties Overview, follows
 * with per-property blocks and a Portfolio Summary, and for 742 clients
 * produces a cover and several pages of empty tables.
 *
 * So every financial page here is conditional on `clientDetails.hasFinancials`,
 * and the closing page carries two mutually exclusive statements at one
 * position: a summary of where the client stands, or the sentence that says the
 * record holds contact details and nothing else. A client with a name and an
 * address gets a short document that reads as finished, because it is.
 *
 * A conditional page costs nothing when it does not render — `visiblePages`
 * filters it out before anything is laid out — which is why the page count runs
 * 5 to 13 across the same fifty masters.
 *
 * ## Every collection is capped, and the caps are measured
 *
 * These pages cannot paginate. `clientDetailsProjection.pure.ts` carries the
 * table; the short version is that expenses are **grouped by category rather
 * than listed** (one client records 100 rows; grouped, the worst case is 14),
 * and assets and liabilities are drawn 8 of a possible 18 and 16 with the count
 * printed beside them.
 *
 * Where a cap bites, the page says so. That is `PORTFOLIO.md`'s F4: the finding
 * against the shipping generator is not that it stops, it is that it stops with
 * nothing on the page saying so.
 *
 * ## Below the cap, the table is as deep as the record
 *
 * A fixed eight-row table beside two recorded assets rules off six empty bands,
 * so every capped table here is drawn at one of a few depths — mutually
 * exclusive `oneOf` variants keyed on the published count, split where the
 * production distribution actually clusters: assets {1:3, 2:4, 3:4, 7:7, 9:1,
 * 18:1} → depths 3/7/8, liabilities {1:4, 2:4, 4:1, 8:8, 16:1} → 2/4/8,
 * employment {1:19, 2:7, 3:2} → 1/2/3, address history {1:8, 3:8, 5:1, 20:1} →
 * 1/3/4, holdings one to four → 1/2/3/4, and expense categories {1:2, 2:2,
 * 14:9} → 2/14. The reserved height is the deepest variant's — the win is that
 * no client's page rules off rows their record does not hold.
 *
 * ## No emoji, and no borrowing capacity
 *
 * The legacy headings carry `🏠`, `📈`, `🏛️`, `💸` and `✓ ✗ ⏳ ▲ ▼ ●`. Harmless
 * when every page is a raster of the browser's own rendering; tofu the moment
 * the page is real text, because these families' faces carry no emoji coverage.
 * The normaliser has already turned every one of them into a word.
 *
 * Borrowing capacity has its own migrated format with its own contract and its
 * own fifty masters. Carrying a copy inside this document would mean two places
 * to fix the same defect.
