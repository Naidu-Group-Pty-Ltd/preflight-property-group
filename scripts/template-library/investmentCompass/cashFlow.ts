/**
 * The 10 Year Cash Flow Analysis, drawn in the ten Investment Compass families.
 *
 * The fifth report format on the family system. It shares `master.ts` with the
 * other four and contributes only its own page sequence — see
 * `docs/template-library/07-investment-compass-families.md`.
 *
 * ## The only prose here is built, never written
 *
 * Investment Compass, the Portfolio Review and the Comparison all bind
 * paragraphs a model wrote, and every height on their pages is a
 * `textHeight(chars)` measured against production, because a paragraph that
 * sets taller than its declared height prints over the block beneath it.
 *
 * The one paragraph in this format is the opening narrative, and the
 * projection composes it from the series' own ends in the legacy document's
 * sentence shapes — so it is bounded by construction and cannot disagree with
 * the tables behind it. Every other figure on every page is a number the
 * report stored, and the risk moves to the other end: **ten-row tables**,
 * five of them, on a page model that cannot paginate. A table is `24 + rows *
 * rowHeight`, and the spacing scales run from 13pt a row to 22 — so the same
 * ten rows are 154pt on Swiss Minimal and 244pt on Private Banking. That is why
 * each series table gets a page rather than sharing one, and why the QA
 * harness's collision measure is what proves it.
 *
 * ## What this format refuses to print
 *
 * `cashFlowProjection.pure.ts` records it in full, and it is the reason this
 * format looks thinner than the record it is drawn from. Four stored figures
 * contradict the series they sit beside:
 *
 *  - `keyMetrics.annualNet` / `weeklyNet` — year-one cash flow, differing from
 *    the series' own year one by a median of $24,793 and agreeing on none of
 *    the 162.
 *  - `initialCosts.totalUpfront` — not the sum of the costs beside it on 132
 *    of 161, off by up to $93,000.
 *  - `annualCosts.totalAnnual` — not the sum of its components on 141 of 162.
 *  - `initialCosts.propertyValue` — $3 on one report whose own series says
 *    $780,000.
 *
 * None is published, so none can be bound. The cost pages therefore carry **no
 * total row**, which looks like an omission and is the opposite: a total that
 * disagrees with the figures above it by $93,000 tells a client the document
 * cannot add up, and gives them no way to tell which line is wrong.
 *
 * ## The chart plots equity, and that is a renderer constraint as well as a choice
 *
 * `chart_style` resolves per family to a line, an area, a bar or a sparkline,
 * so a chart in this catalogue has to be drawable by all four. Equity is
 * positive on all 4,860 stored elements and rises; the cash-flow series is
 * negative on 4,856 of them. Bar charts could not draw a negative bar at all
 * until this change (`charts.html.ts`), and the shortfall is carried by the
 * table and the KPI band instead — where a negative number is a number rather
 * than a bar drawn downward off the plot.

/**
 * What the adviser-reviewed path does not publish, and this master must not

 *
 * Two producers feed these masters. `projectCashFlow` over a stored row
 * publishes everything. `applyLiveCashFlowProjection` over the series an
 * adviser reviewed on screen publishes a strict subset, and each omission is
 * deliberate and recorded in `liveProjectionRow.ts`:
 *
 *  - `scenarios` / `scenarioBasis` are deleted, because only the series on
 *    screen was reviewed and the stored three are not a comparison against it;
 *  - `roi` is absent from every year, because the wire has no such field and
 *    "the stored derivation this repo has no second implementation of"
 *    (`cashFlowAdapter.ts`) — so a figure invented here would be a number in a

 * "—", and three assumption lines reading "Conservative capital growth ·
