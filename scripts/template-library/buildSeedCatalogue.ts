/**
 * Builds the seeded Template Library catalogue and emits it as a SQL migration.
 *
 * Templates are authored here as data, validated against the *real*
 * `ReportTemplateSchema` and the *real* production renderer allow-list, and
 * written to the database. They are deliberately not bundled into the app: the
 * Builder list already documents that PDF-imported schemas can reach hundreds
 * of megabytes, and a catalogue that ships in the JS bundle would cost every
 * user — including the ones who never open the library — on first paint.
 *
 * Run:  npx tsx scripts/template-library/buildSeedCatalogue.ts
 * (or)  npm run templates:library:seed
 *
 * The generated migration is idempotent: it upserts on (slug, version), so
 * re-running it updates the seeded entries and never duplicates them. It only
 * ever touches rows whose slug is in the seed set, so an operator's own
 * promoted entries are never disturbed.
 *
 * ## Two authoring systems, one catalogue
 *
 * `SEED_TEMPLATES` are the forty *voice* templates — built from the five studio
 * voices keyed to the catalogue's `style` axis. `INVESTMENT_COMPASS_TEMPLATES`
 * are the *family* templates, built from the approved Claude Design Investment
 * Compass catalogue's manifest model. Both compile to the same
 * `ReportTemplate` schema and pass the same gates; only their authoring
 * vocabulary differs, and each gets the design-consistency check that suits it.

/**
 * Where the generated catalogue lands.
 *
 * **Bump this filename whenever the catalogue changes after the current one has
 * been applied to production.** Supabase records a migration as applied by its
 * version prefix and never runs it again, so editing an already-applied file
 * changes the repository and nothing else — the new rows would never reach the
 * database, and the only symptom would be templates missing from the UI.
 *
 * Because the generated SQL upserts the *whole* catalogue on `(slug, version)`,
 * a new file is a complete replacement, not a delta: applying it brings a fresh
 * database and a long-running one to exactly the same state. Superseded files
 * stay on disk, so an environment that has never been seeded still replays the
 * full history in order.
 *
 * | Applied to production | File |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | yes — 12 templates | `20260801093000_seed_template_library.sql` |
 * | maybe — 40 templates, pre-design-system | `20260802093000_seed_template_library_v2.sql` |
 * | maybe — 40 templates in the NPC voices | `20260803090000_seed_template_library_v3.sql` |
 * | yes — 93: the voices plus 50 Investment Compass masters | `20260811120000_seed_template_library_v4_investment_compass.sql` |
 * | yes — 543: every format's masters | `20260812090000_seed_template_library_v5_borrowing_capacity_portfolio.sql` |
 * | yes — 543, with the date and conditional fixes | `20260815150000_seed_template_library_v6_binding_fixes.sql` |
 * | not yet — 543, with the voice templates' disclaimer bound too | the one below |
 *
 * v4 was a new file rather than an edit of v3 because it added rows and wrote a
 * column (`design_meta`) that v3 did not know about.
 *
 * **v5 exists because v4 had already been applied.** The Borrowing Capacity
 * masters were generated back into v4 after it ran in production, and Supabase
 * records a migration as applied by its version prefix — so those fifty rows
 * would have sat in the repository and never reached the database, with the
 * only symptom being fifty templates missing from the library. Confirmed
 * against the live project: `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` carries
 * `20260811120000`, and `template_library_entries` held 93 rows. This file
 * carries all three of the formats added since.
 *
 * Its **name** says two of them because that is what it carried when it was
 * written, and the name is not what Supabase keys on — the `20260812090000`
 * prefix is. Renaming it would be cosmetic while it is unapplied and actively
 * harmful once it is not: a file whose prefix is already recorded never runs
 * again, whatever it is called. If v5 has been applied by the time the
 * Comparison masters land, they need a v6 rather than an edit here.
 *
 * **That moment arrived, and v6 is it.** On 15 Aug 2026 the check finally came
 * back the other way: `20260812090000` IS in
 * `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` and `template_library_entries` holds
 * 543 rows, so v5 has run. The binding fixes for the Client Details Form and
 * the 10 Year Cash Flow — the `| date` filter on every `report.generatedDate`,
 * the conditionals that stop a master printing a label for data the
 * adviser-reviewed path withholds, and the residence variants — were
 * regenerated back into v5 first, which would have left every one of them in
 * the repository and none of them in the database. The only symptom would have
 * been that the exported PDFs did not change, which is the hardest kind of
 * failure to see: nothing is red and the product does not move.
 *
 * The generated SQL upserts the whole catalogue on `(slug, version)`, so v6 is
 * a complete replacement rather than a delta — a fresh database replays v1..v6
 * and a production one applies only v6, and both land on the same 543 rows.
 *
 * **And v7, one hour later, for the same reason.** `apply-migration.yml` ran v6
 * against production at 15:52 and recorded `20260815150000`, so the one-query
 * check now answers "applied" for v6 too and editing it would be inert.
 *
 * v7 exists because the disclaimer fix was incomplete. `disclaimerPage()` binds
 * `{{org.disclaimer}}` in `investmentCompass/blocks.ts`, which is 500 of the
 * 543 — the 43 **voice** templates come from `template-library/blocks.ts` and
 * kept the baked boilerplate. Measured after v6 applied:
 *
 *     disclaimer_bound      500
 *     still_baked_literal   534     <- 500 fallbacks + 34 voice templates
 *
 * Two documents out of one product disagreeing about what the firm's
 * disclaimer says is worse than both being wrong, which is why this is a
 * migration rather than a note.
 *
 * Run the same one-query check before editing this file: if
 * `20260815170000` is already recorded, the next change needs a v8.
 *
 * ## v8 — the report's own structure
 *
 * It was recorded, so this is v8. The Investment Compass masters now carry the
 * document the model wrote — `report_content`, chunked into conditional pages
 * by `packMarkdownPages` — because nothing did. `{{sections.*}}` was bound by 0
 * of the 13 active `report_templates` rows and the projection published nothing
 * from that column, so a Compass render was the calculator's scorecard on a
 * fixed page sequence with the report itself absent. Measured on one address at
 * all five tiers, the model writes 9 (snapshot) to 107 (compass) headings every
 * time. See `docs/reports/INVESTMENT.md` and PR #2162.
