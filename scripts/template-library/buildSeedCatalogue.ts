/**
 * Builds the seeded Template Library catalogue and emits it as a SQL migration.
 *
 * Templates are authored here as data, validated against the *real*
 * `ReportTemplateSchema` and the *real* production renderer allow-list, and
 * written to the database. They are deliberately not bundled into the app: the
 * Builder list already documents that PDF-imported schemas can reach hundreds
 * of megabytes, and a catalogue that ships in the JS bundle would cost every
 * user — including the ones who never open the library — on first paint.
 *
 * Run:  npx tsx scripts/template-library/buildSeedCatalogue.ts
 * (or)  npm run templates:library:seed
 *
 * The generated migration is idempotent: it upserts on (slug, version), so
 * re-running it updates the seeded entries and never duplicates them. It only
 * ever touches rows whose slug is in the seed set, so an operator's own
 * promoted entries are never disturbed.
 *
 * ## Two authoring systems, one catalogue
 *
 * `SEED_TEMPLATES` are the forty *voice* templates — built from the five studio
 * voices keyed to the catalogue's `style` axis. `INVESTMENT_COMPASS_TEMPLATES`
 * are the *family* templates, built from the approved Claude Design Investment
 * Compass catalogue's manifest model. Both compile to the same
 * `ReportTemplate` schema and pass the same gates; only their authoring
 * vocabulary differs, and each gets the design-consistency check that suits it.

/**
 * Where the generated catalogue lands.
 *
 * **Bump this filename whenever the catalogue changes after the current one has
 * been applied to production.** Supabase records a migration as applied by its
 * version prefix and never runs it again, so editing an already-applied file
 * changes the repository and nothing else — the new rows would never reach the
 * database, and the only symptom would be templates missing from the UI.
 *
 * Because the generated SQL upserts the *whole* catalogue on `(slug, version)`,
 * a new file is a complete replacement, not a delta: applying it brings a fresh
 * database and a long-running one to exactly the same state. Superseded files
 * stay on disk, so an environment that has never been seeded still replays the
 * full history in order.
 *
 * | Applied to production | File |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | yes — 12 templates | `20260801093000_seed_template_library.sql` |
 * | maybe — 40 templates, pre-design-system | `20260802093000_seed_template_library_v2.sql` |
 * | maybe — 40 templates in the NPC voices | `20260803090000_seed_template_library_v3.sql` |
 * | yes — 93: the voices plus 50 Investment Compass masters | `20260811120000_seed_template_library_v4_investment_compass.sql` |
 * | yes — 543: every format's masters | `20260812090000_seed_template_library_v5_borrowing_capacity_portfolio.sql` |
 * | yes — 543, with the date and conditional fixes | `20260815150000_seed_template_library_v6_binding_fixes.sql` |
 * | not yet — 543, with the voice templates' disclaimer bound too | the one below |
 *
 * v4 was a new file rather than an edit of v3 because it added rows and wrote a
 * column (`design_meta`) that v3 did not know about.
 *
 * **v5 exists because v4 had already been applied.** The Borrowing Capacity
 * masters were generated back into v4 after it ran in production, and Supabase
 * records a migration as applied by its version prefix — so those fifty rows
 * would have sat in the repository and never reached the database, with the
 * only symptom being fifty templates missing from the library. Confirmed
 * against the live project: `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` carries
 * `20260811120000`, and `template_library_entries` held 93 rows. This file
 * carries all three of the formats added since.
 *
 * Its **name** says two of them because that is what it carried when it was
 * written, and the name is not what Supabase keys on — the `20260812090000`
 * prefix is. Renaming it would be cosmetic while it is unapplied and actively
 * harmful once it is not: a file whose prefix is already recorded never runs
 * again, whatever it is called. If v5 has been applied by the time the
 * Comparison masters land, they need a v6 rather than an edit here.
 *
 * **That moment arrived, and v6 is it.** On 15 Aug 2026 the check finally came
 * back the other way: `20260812090000` IS in
 * `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` and `template_library_entries` holds
 * 543 rows, so v5 has run. The binding fixes for the Client Details Form and
 * the 10 Year Cash Flow — the `| date` filter on every `report.generatedDate`,
 * the conditionals that stop a master printing a label for data the
 * adviser-reviewed path withholds, and the residence variants — were
 * regenerated back into v5 first, which would have left every one of them in
 * the repository and none of them in the database. The only symptom would have
 * been that the exported PDFs did not change, which is the hardest kind of
 * failure to see: nothing is red and the product does not move.
 *
 * The generated SQL upserts the whole catalogue on `(slug, version)`, so v6 is
 * a complete replacement rather than a delta — a fresh database replays v1..v6
 * and a production one applies only v6, and both land on the same 543 rows.
 *
 * **And v7, one hour later, for the same reason.** `apply-migration.yml` ran v6
 * against production at 15:52 and recorded `20260815150000`, so the one-query
 * check now answers "applied" for v6 too and editing it would be inert.
 *
 * v7 exists because the disclaimer fix was incomplete. `disclaimerPage()` binds
 * `{{org.disclaimer}}` in `investmentCompass/blocks.ts`, which is 500 of the
 * 543 — the 43 **voice** templates come from `template-library/blocks.ts` and
 * kept the baked boilerplate. Measured after v6 applied:
 *
 *     disclaimer_bound      500
 *     still_baked_literal   534     <- 500 fallbacks + 34 voice templates
 *
 * Two documents out of one product disagreeing about what the firm's
 * disclaimer says is worse than both being wrong, which is why this is a
 * migration rather than a note.
 *
 * Run the same one-query check before editing this file: if
 * `20260815170000` is already recorded, the next change needs a v8.
 *
 * ## v8 — the report's own structure
 *
 * It was recorded, so this is v8. The Investment Compass masters now carry the
 * document the model wrote — `report_content`, chunked into conditional pages
 * by `packMarkdownPages` — because nothing did. `{{sections.*}}` was bound by 0
 * of the 13 active `report_templates` rows and the projection published nothing
 * from that column, so a Compass render was the calculator's scorecard on a
 * fixed page sequence with the report itself absent. Measured on one address at
 * all five tiers, the model writes 9 (snapshot) to 107 (compass) headings every
 * time. See `docs/reports/INVESTMENT.md` and PR #2162.
 *
 * ## v12 — the verdict sentence is composed, never interpolated
 *
 * The two verdict bodies bound `recommendation.grade`/`.score` inside a
 * hand-written "Graded … out of 100" literal. On a row with no score the
 * sentence printed with the holes left in — "Graded  at  out of 100", shipped
 * on every Due Diligence fork ever produced — and the hardcoded weighting
 * clause ("growth, location, yield, demand and risk" / "five weighted
 * dimensions") misstated every variant score. Both bodies now bind
 * `recommendation.gradedLine` / `.gradedDetailLine`, composed by the
 * projection from the score's own dimensions and absent when the record
 * cannot say them (scoreSections.pure.ts).
 *
 * ## v13 — the cash flow table foots
 *
 * `20261112000000` is recorded and `template_library_entries` holds 543 rows,
 * so v12 has run and editing it would be inert. v13 carries the Financial
 * position page's new lines: the engine subtracts eight annual cost components
 * and the table drew four, so on 262 Pallas Street, Maryborough the rows came
 * to $10,780 against a net position built on $12,880 — and the row that left
 * water rates out was labelled "Council and water rates". The projection now
 * folds water into that row and letting fees into management, and publishes
 * land tax and strata (`financials.annualOtherCosts`) and the occupancy gap
 * (`financials.annualVacancyAllowance`) as conditional rows that draw only
 * where there is a figure to draw.
 *
 * ## v14 — the Compass stops drawing the Financial Analysis
 *
 * `20261202000000` is recorded, so v13 has run and editing it would be inert.
 *
 * One Investment master serves five document kinds, so the acquisition table,
 * the cash flow and the ten-year equity chart were drawn on all five — and
 * `compassSectionRegistry.ts` has said since v2.0 that "ALL detailed financial
 * modelling ... lives in the separate Financial Analysis Report and MUST NOT
 * appear here". The generator obeyed it and the master did not, so the
 * Investment Compass opened on purchase price, gross yield, LVR and a
 * ten-year projection while the Financial Analysis carried the location case.
 *
 * v14 makes those three pages conditional on `report.drawsFinancialModelling`,
 * published by `reportBindingProjection` from `tierContent.pure.ts` — the one
 * module that decides what a tier's document contains. The projection also
 * WITHHOLDS the modelling bindings on those tiers, which is what makes the
 * drop clean: a page kept with nothing to bind prints labelled empty rows.
 *
 * ## v15 — the running head names the chapter, and a column fits what it carries
 *
 * `20261203000000` **is recorded** — checked 19 Sep 2026 against the project's
 * applied migration list (980 of them), which is the one-query check this
 * header has always asked for. So v14 has run, editing it would be inert, and
 * this is v15.
 *
 * Two master changes:
 *
 * The running head read `Part 03 · Report` on every page of every document,
 * and a page carried a heading reading `The report`. The head now names the
 * chapter a page is in, derived from the same packing that decides the page
 * breaks — estimated by the projection and overwritten by the renderer's
 * pre-pass, so the two cannot disagree — and the `The report` heading is
 * deleted.
 *
 * And the Commercial Capacity constraints table printed over the explanation
 * beneath it on 4 of 50 masters: the four value columns took a fixed 330 pt,
 * leaving the test name 87-117 pt on the families with the deepest margins,
 * while three of the ten `CONSTRAINT_LABELS` run 24 to 31 characters. Measured
 * in Chromium at A4 across all fifty, for the longest string each column can
 * carry and for the column heads: Test 147.8, Permits 66.6, Policy 42.0,
 * This deal 53.8, Status 73.9. The value columns are 75/48/60/82 now and the
 * name takes the rest, at least 152 pt everywhere. Re-measured: 0 of 50
 * overlap, 0 of 400 rows wrap.
 *
 * The version is `20261204020000`, not `...000000`: two other migrations
 * already hold `20261204000000` and `20261204010000`, and
 * `check-migration-version-collisions.mjs` is right that one version records
 * one ledger row, so a second file at that version can never be told apart
 * from applied. And a seed alone is not the change — `20261204030000`
 * re-copies the ACTIVE masters from it, because an adopted master is a COPY
 * and nothing else updates a copy after adoption.
 *
 * ## v16 — the verdict fits its box, and the running head names the chapter
 *
 * `20261204020000` **is recorded** — checked 19 Sep 2026 against the project's
 * applied migration list (986 of them), which is the one-query check this
 * header has always asked for. So v15 has run, editing it would be inert, and
 * this is v16.
 *
 * Two master changes, both geometry, both measured against all fifty.
 *
 * **The verdict heading printed over the KPI band.** `verdict()` reserved
 * `scale.verdict * 2.2` at a leading of 1.1 — exactly two lines — and the
 * reservation was never measured against the sentence that fills it. At this
 * catalogue's own 0.52 display advance, `RECOMMENDATION_BY_GRADE` set past two
 * lines on **27 of 50** masters unqualified, and on **50 of 50** once
 * `qualifyRecommendation` began appending its coverage sentence. The masters
 * position every block at an absolute `y`, so the surplus did not overflow the
 * page — it printed on top of what came next, and every arithmetic check in
 * the build passed. On 42 Patya Circuit `$1,975,000` and `$850` were struck
 * through by the heading's last two lines.
 *
 * The dashboard page has 15pt of slack above the footer on 49 of the 50, so
 * the block could not grow. It keeps its footprint exactly and the heading is
 * fitted to it: `fitToLines` picks the largest quarter-point size at which the
 * longest publishable headline still sets in two lines. 23 masters were
 * already inside it and are byte-identical; the rest move from 23-34.25pt to
 * 16.5-19.5pt. The coverage sentence also leaves the heading for a `scopeNote`
 * of its own (`splitVerdictScope`), which is a projection change rather than a
 * master one.
 *
 * **The running head said `Part 05 · Report` on 29 of 36 pages.** v15 made the
 * head name the chapter and reached eleven masters: `furniture()` draws the
 * part AND the section on a railed family, and on a running-head family draws
 * the part and DISCARDS the section. The Compass's report pages now pass an
 * explicit `headMarker` — the part number plus the chapter — which only the
 * running-head branch reads, so the railed eleven and the other nine formats'
 * 450 masters are untouched.
 *
 * The version is `20261207000000`: `20261206000000` is taken and already
 * applied. `20261207010000` re-copies the ACTIVE masters from it, because an
 * adopted master is a COPY and nothing else updates a copy after adoption.
 *
 * ## v17 — the running head stops repeating the part
 *
 * One master change, on the 39 running-head masters, and nothing else in the
 * catalogue moves.
 *
 * v16 fixed the half of the running head that was DISCARDED and left the half
 * that was REPEATED. It passed `Part NN · {{narrative.chapters.i}}`, so the
 * Investment Compass issued for 97 Poole Road, Kellyville on 20 Sep 2026
 * carried `Part 07 · <chapter>` on **twenty-six consecutive pages** — true,
 * because the body is one part, and saying nothing twenty-six times over.
 *
 * A running head exists to say where the reader is. Across a single part the
 * part number does not; the chapter does. The part structure is on the
 * contents page, which is where it varies. The marker is the chapter alone.
 *
 * The ten characters that frees are not a line — the marker sits in 34% of the
 * measure, about 43 characters, against `CHAPTER_MAX_CHARS` of 64 — so the
 * worst case still takes both lines the rule reserves. Measured on the twelve
 * chapters that report actually produced: three wrapped to a second ragged
 * right-aligned line with the prefix, one wraps without it.
 *
 * A binding change inside one text block, on 39 masters. The railed eleven
 * draw the part as an eyebrow ABOVE the chapter rather than a prefix beside
 * it, so the repetition is subordinate by construction and they are untouched;
 * the other nine formats' 450 masters pass no `headMarker` and are
 * byte-identical.
 *
 * The version is `20261208000000`. `20261208010000` re-copies the ACTIVE
 * masters from it, for the reason above.
 *
 * ## v18 — the assessment page said five and showed three
 *
 * Checked before editing, as the line below asked: `20261208000000` and
 * `20261208010000` are both in the applied migration list (990 of them), so
 * this change is a v18.
 *
 * ONE page, on the 50 Investment Compass masters, and nothing else in the
 * catalogue moves. `The assessment` carried the heading **"Five dimensions,
 * weighted"** over a table that drew THREE rows on the 9 Hollow Street
 * Compass of 20 Sep 2026 and FOUR on 1 Crestview Avenue and 97 Poole Road.
 * The projection publishes nothing bindable for a dimension the engine did
 * not score — an absence is omitted, never worded — so the row count is the
 * count of what was measured, and a heading promising five contradicts the
 * table under it on every report that could not score one.
 *
 * Its third column was headed `Weight`, and the figure in it is the ADJUSTED
 * weight: 97 Poole Road printed `Demand 27 · 5%` where the published method
 * weights demand at 15%, with nothing on the page to tell the two apart. The
 * header names it and the standfirst says what it is.
 *
 * And one BINDING, on two of the 43 voice masters: their Recommendation page
 * bound `{{recommendation.rationale}}`, which the projection does not publish,
 * so the decision body resolved to the empty string on every render. The
 * Investment Compass master corrected exactly that in its own block and these
 * two kept it. They bind `gradedDetailLine` now — found by a spec asserting
 * that no master binds a `recommendation.*` path the projection does not
 * publish, which is the general form of the `scopeNote` defect in the other
 * direction.
 *
 * Three text changes inside two blocks on one page, plus two bindings. No page
 * gains or loses one, no block moves, and the other eight formats' 400 masters
 * are byte-identical. The standfirst is one sentence longer than the
 * one it replaces and no more: at two extra sentences the geometry gate
 * refused three masters, at one it refused `le-03` by 7pt, and the wording
 * shipped is the longest that clears all 50.
 *
 * The version is `20261209000000`. `20261209010000` re-copies the ACTIVE
 * masters from it, for the reason above.
 *
 * ## v19 — two placeholder words in slots that name things
 *
 * Checked before editing, as the line below asked: `20261209000000` and
 * `20261209010000` are both in the applied migration list (1,012 of them, the
 * latest being `20261211000000`), so this change is a **v19**.
 *
 * Two literals on the 50 Investment Compass masters, and nothing else in the
 * catalogue moves.
 *
 * **The risk register's rating read `Noted`.** The record holds a bare risk
 * STRING from `investment_score.risks` and no severity at all, and the
 * platform's exposure vocabulary is `Low | Moderate | High | Not assessed`
 * (`riskRegister.pure.ts`). `Noted` was a fifth word in a four-word
 * vocabulary, in the column that states the EXPOSURE, and it is absent from
 * `RATING_PALETTE` too — which is why the chip display already drew it
 * neutral. `severityFromRating` answers null for both, so neither draws a
 * bar; what changes is that a reader is given the platform's own word for
 * "nobody assessed this" instead of one it uses nowhere else.
 * `confidence: 'Indicative'` is deliberately KEPT: it is in
 * `CONFIDENCE_PALETTE`, and it is an honest qualifier for an unverified
 * one-liner rather than a claim the record cannot support.
 *
 * **The Opportunities list's term read `Noted`.** Every sibling definition
 * list on that page carries a real term naming what the row is about —
 * `Location`, `Yield`, `Risk` — and the record gives an opportunity as one
 * unlabelled string, so any term in that slot is invented. The heading
 * already said "Opportunities", so the 160pt term column carried a word that
 * repeated nothing and meant nothing. It is a `callout` now, which is the
 * container the same page already uses for one unqualified statement ("No
 * risk recorded"), and it is height-neutral: the definition list declared
 * 30 + one ~45pt row against the callout's 72.
 *
 * A sweep of every literal `term:`, `rating:`, `confidence:`, `value:` and
 * `status:` across all eleven format files found no other placeholder — the
 * rest are real labels (`Location`, `Yield`, `Risk`, `Suburb`, `Value and
 * equity`, `Cash contributed`). These two were the class.
 *
 * ## What the diff actually is, measured rather than claimed
 *
 * Parsed out of both files and compared schema by schema — 2,172 in each:
 *
 *   * **34 schemas changed**, and every one is an Investment Compass master.
 *     The other ten formats' 493 masters are byte-identical, and the changed
 *     lines are exactly 50 distinct family names plus the two header lines
 *     (the `@effect` probe and the baseline's release id).
 *   * `"rating":"Noted"` **50 → 0**, `"rating":"Not assessed"` **0 → 50**.
 *   * `"type":"definition-list"` **−32**, `"type":"callout"` **+34**.
 *
 * That `+34` against `−32` is the part worth writing down, because the first
 * draft of this comment claimed "no page gains or loses one" and that is
 * **false**. Two masters — **Analyst Folio** and **Monograph** — gain a block
 * (333→334 and 320→321) while keeping all seven of their definition lists.
 *
 * They never carried the Opportunities list. It is an OPTIONAL item, and
 * `ifItFits` keeps one only while `y + height + SLACK <= contentBottom`. The
 * definition list declared `30 + one ~45pt row` ≈ 75pt; the callout declares
 * 72. On those two variants those three points are the difference, so a block
 * they had been dropping silently now fits. That is `ifItFits` doing exactly
 * its job — and it is a small improvement, not a regression: two more masters
 * now show an opportunity the record holds instead of discarding it.
 *
 * `SLACK` is untouched at 36, so the comfort margin that stops an optional
 * block printing over the one above it is unchanged.
 *
 * The version is `20261212000000`. `20261212010000` re-copies the ACTIVE
 * masters from it, for the reason above.
 *
 * ## v19, regenerated — and why it is still a v19
 *
 * The one-query check the line below demands was run on 22 September 2026 and
 * answers the OPPOSITE of what a fourth seed release would need:
 * `20261212000000` is **not** recorded. 1,012 migrations are applied and the
 * latest is `20261211000000`, so v19's own pair has never landed — it is
 * unmerged, on one branch, in one pull request. The condition this header
 * states for a v20 is that the previous version is RECORDED, and it is not,
 * so the right move is to regenerate v19 in place rather than stack a second
 * seed migration on top of an unapplied one.
 *
 * What made that necessary is a gap in this repository rather than a change
 * of mind. The seed is GENERATED, and until now **nothing compared it to the
 * definitions that generate it** — so the generator could be run or not run
 * and the tree looked identical either way. Four commits landed after v19 was
 * written and two of them changed what the definitions produce:
 *
 *   * `bcd1bf5` — a bound KPI note was budgeted one line and sets two, which
 *     grows the DASHBOARD grid on page 2 of **142** masters by 8 to 21pt, and
 *     pushes the blocks below it down by the same amount (76 callouts, 59 text
 *     blocks, 40 data tables, 31 decision boxes, 18 strengths-watch panels).
 *   * `b842936` — the cover facts had their own density behaviour and it
 *     disagreed with the family's on 22 of 50, so `valueSize` on page 0 comes
 *     off a literal and onto the scale: **140** masters 11pt → 9pt (compact)
 *     and **80** masters 14pt → 13pt (spacious).
 *
 * Neither had reached the migration, and the migration is what a deployment
 * applies. A fix that reaches only the definitions reaches no document at
 * all — which is exactly how seed v18 came to merge without landing, the
 * failure `20261212010000`'s `@effect` line was added to catch one layer
 * further down. `npm run templates:library:seed:check` closes the layer above
 * it: it re-derives the SQL and compares the BYTES, naming the templates that
 * drifted, and `ci.yml`'s `template-geometry` job runs it beside the render
 * gate. Measured both ways before it was trusted — exit 1 on the stale file
 * (301 of 543 named), exit 0 on the fresh one.
 *
 * ## What the regenerated release is, measured rather than claimed
 *
 * Parsed out of both files and compared template by template — 543 in each:
 *
 *   * **301 of 543 templates differ**, all of them design-family masters. The
 *     43 voice templates are byte-identical. By format: 47 Investment Compass,
 *     37 Portfolio Review, 36 Cash Flow Comparison, 35 Borrowing Capacity,
 *     35 Property Comparison, 23 Ten Year Cash Flow, 22 each of Client Details,
 *     Report Q&A, Commercial Capacity and Market Intelligence.
 *   * **No template's page count changes, and no template's block count
 *     changes** — checked rather than asserted, because the first draft of the
 *     v19 comment above claimed exactly that about the placeholder words and
 *     was false. Every difference is a size, a height or a `y`.
 *   * The two changes do not touch the same grid: of the grids that moved,
 *     none changed both its `valueSize` and its `height`. The cover facts are
 *     page 0; the note that grew is page 2.
 *
 * The placeholder-word measurement above still stands as the record of THAT
 * change; these are the two that joined it.
 *
 * Run the same one-query check before editing this file: if
 * `20261212000000` is already recorded, the next change needs a v20.
 *
 * ## v20 — one summary page that flows into the report
 *
 * Checked before editing, as the line above asked, on 23 Sep 2026 through
 * the ledger (all 1,036 recorded versions read): v19 IS recorded — Lovable
 * stamped it `20261209010000` and its refresh `20261211000000` — so this
 * change is a **v20**, and v19's file is not touched.
 *
 * The owner sent the 23 Sep 2026 Compass for 97 Poole Road and 9 Hollow
 * Street back for its white space: pages 3 to 6 were 54%, 68%, 66% and 74%
 * empty, on every master, because each summary element was a page of its own
 * laid out for the worst case and the report's body waited on the page after
 * the last of them. Every master now carries an `Executive summary` page for
 * the tiers whose front matter flows (`frontMatterFlagsFor`): the verdict,
 * the published figures, the property, the strengths and watch-points and —
 * on the Compass alone — the grade's dimensions, with the body opening in the
 * room left under them. It is a `flow` page (`flowLayout.ts`), so its blocks
 * stack from what they draw. The typed pages it replaces are KEPT, made
 * conditional on the report not flowing, which is how the composite tier
 * prints exactly as it did.
 *
 * ## What the release is, measured rather than claimed
 *
 * Parsed out of the v19 and v20 files and compared template by template —
 * 543 in each:
 *
 *   * **50 of 543 differ**, and they are exactly the 50 Investment Compass
 *     masters. The other ten formats' 493 masters and the 43 voice templates
 *     are byte-identical.
 *   * **Every one of the 50 gains one page** (the summary), and **between 9
 *     and 13 blocks** — 2 masters +9, 4 +10, 19 +11, 1 +12, 24 +13. Nothing
 *     is removed, because the typed pages stay for the tier that draws them.
 *
 * The version is `20261219060000`. `20261219070000` re-copies the ACTIVE
 * masters from it, by the v15 mechanism, unchanged. It was written as
 * `20261219000000` / `…010000` and moved before it was applied anywhere,
 * because main had meanwhile taken both versions for its restatements
 * (`20261219000000_restate_mfa_recovery_code_consumption` onwards) — a version
 * is the order a migration runs in, so two files cannot share one.
 *
 * ## v21 — the lead photograph on the covers drawn without one
 *
 * Checked before editing on 25 Sep 2026, through the ledger (all 1,051
 * recorded versions read). v20 IS recorded: the seed as `20261219060000` and
 * its refresh as `20261219070000`. So this change is a **v21**, and v20's
 * file is not touched.
 *
 * Five of the fifty Investment masters were designed around photographs. The
 * other forty-five printed none, however many the report held. The owner
 * asked for one on those covers (25 Sep 2026), and the cover's ground decides
 * where it goes (`withCoverPhotograph`):
 *   - The 16 FIELD covers take the lead photograph behind the whole sheet,
 *     under two passes of the field's own scrim.
 *   - The 18 BANDED covers take it inside the band, under the same two
 *     passes.
 *   - The 11 PAPER covers are left as drawn.
 *
 * Why two passes: one pass of the 0.55 scrim leaves the cover's small type at
 * 3.48:1 over a white facade, measured on the Private Banking palette. Two
 * passes come to about 0.80 and 7.89:1, which clears the 7:1 print floor in
 * REPORT_RULES §2. The five photographic masters keep their one pass, because
 * their type was designed for it.
 *
 * ## What the release is, measured rather than claimed
 *
 * Parsed out of the v20 and v21 files and compared row by row, 543 in each:
 *
 *   * **34 of 543 differ**, and they are exactly those 34 Investment Compass
 *     masters. The other 16 Investment masters, the other nine formats' 450
 *     masters and the 43 voice templates are byte-identical.
 *   * In each of the 34, **the cover gains exactly three blocks**: the
 *     photograph and two passes of the scrim, all conditional on the
 *     photograph. Every other page, every other block, their order and their
 *     ids are unchanged. The blocks are built after the rest of the master, so
 *     they take new ids rather than shifting old ones. The cover's
 *     `preview_schema` gains the same three. No other column changes except
 *     these two:
 *       - `required_bindings` gains `property.images.0` on all 34;
 *       - fifteen field masters list `hero` among their block types for the
 *         first time. The sixteenth, Ribbon, already drew one.
 *
 * `20261222100000` re-copies the ACTIVE masters from it, by the v15
 * mechanism, unchanged. Run the same one-query check before editing this
 * file: if `20261222090000` is already recorded, the next change needs a v22.

 * Does the seed migration on disk still say what the template definitions

 *
 * ## The defect this exists for
 *
 * The seeded catalogue is GENERATED — the file's own header says so, and
 * `npm run templates:library:seed` is the only thing that may write it. But
 * nothing anywhere compared the two, so the generator could be run or not run
 * and the repository looked identical either way. Measured on this branch,
 * 22 September 2026: seed v19 was written at `5d17954` and FOUR commits
 * changed what the definitions produce after it —
 *
 *   * `bcd1bf5` grew 142 dashboard KPI grids by 8–20pt, because a bound note
 *     was budgeted one line and sets two;
 *   * `b842936` took the cover facts off a density literal, moving 440 grids
 *     (280 from 11pt to 9pt, 160 from 14pt to 13pt);
 *
 * — and the migration still carried the pre-`5d17954` geometry for all of
 * them. The seed is what a deployment applies, so a fix that only reaches the
 * definitions reaches no document at all. That is precisely how v18 came to
 * merge without landing, which `20261212010000`'s own `@effect` line was
 * added to catch one layer further down.
 *
 * ## Why the comparison is the ARTEFACT and not a count
 *
 * A count baseline absorbs a change: one master gains a block while another
 * loses one and the number holds — the lesson `check-edge-functions.mjs` paid
 * for when `TS2304` was frozen by count and a live `ReferenceError` went with
 * it. So this compares the bytes the generator would write against the bytes
 * on disk, and where they differ it names the templates rather than the
 * offset, because a 40 MB diff sends nobody to a remedy.
 *
 * It is `investmentCompassSource.spec.ts`' rule one layer out: that spec
 * re-checks the generated families against the Design file's own evaluation
 * every run, and this checks the generated MIGRATION against the definitions
 * those families feed.

-- Read-only by construction: the runner refuses anything that is not a
-- lone SELECT.
-- =====================================================================
-- Template Library — seeded catalogue.
--
-- Generated by scripts/template-library/buildSeedCatalogue.ts. Do not hand-edit:
-- edit the template definitions and re-run \`npm run templates:library:seed\`,
-- which re-validates every schema against the live Zod contract and the
-- production renderer allow-list before it writes anything.
--
-- ${all.length} templates, of which ${readyCount} are production-ready (their report type has a
-- Template Builder adapter). The rest are browsable, previewable and copyable
-- but cannot be activated for live report generation — that limitation belongs
-- to the adapter registry, not to the library, and is surfaced on each card.
--
-- ${FAMILY_TEMPLATES.length} of them are design-family masters (${INVESTMENT_COMPASS_TEMPLATES.length} Investment Compass,
-- ${BORROWING_CAPACITY_TEMPLATES.length} Borrowing Capacity, ${PORTFOLIO_TEMPLATES.length} Portfolio Performance Review,
-- ${COMPARISON_TEMPLATES.length} Property Comparison, ${CASH_FLOW_COMPASS_TEMPLATES.length} 10 Year Cash Flow,
-- ${CLIENT_DETAILS_TEMPLATES.length} Client Details Form,
-- ${CASH_FLOW_COMPARISON_TEMPLATES.length} Cash Flow Comparison,
-- ${REPORT_QA_TEMPLATES.length} Report Q&A,
-- ${COMMERCIAL_CAPACITY_TEMPLATES.length} Commercial & Industrial Capacity,
-- ${MARKET_INTELLIGENCE_TEMPLATES.length} Market Intelligence), which additionally carry
-- \`design_meta\` (family, variant axis, density, resolved manifest, colourway
-- set). Requires 20260811110000_template_library_design_meta.sql.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT: upserts on (slug, version). Re-running updates the seeded rows
-- and never duplicates them. Rows an operator promoted themselves are matched
-- by neither slug nor version and are therefore never touched.
-- =====================================================================

-- ── The baseline this release is judged against ───────────────────────────
--
-- Captured BEFORE the upsert below, because the upsert overwrites \`schema\` in
-- place: \`ON CONFLICT (slug, version)\` with \`version\` = 1 for every entry, so
-- there is exactly one row per slug and the previous release's schema is gone
-- the moment this statement runs. Nothing else in the database retains it.
--
-- What it is for: the refresh that follows this seed must not replace a master
-- a tenant has edited. It can only know that by comparing the tenant's copy
-- against what the library held when they took it — which is this digest.
--
-- \`tokens.colors\` is removed before hashing, and ONLY that path, because
-- \`applyColourwayToSchema\` spreads \`...tokens\` and replaces \`colors\` alone.
-- So a supported colourway difference is accounted for exactly, and a tenant's
-- typeface (\`tokens.fonts\`), page, block, section, binding or branding is
-- fully visible to the comparison rather than hidden by a loose exclusion.
--
-- jsonb's text form is canonical — keys sorted, whitespace normalised — so the
-- digest is stable across writes and comparable between rows.
