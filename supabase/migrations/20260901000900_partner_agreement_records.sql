-- A downloadable, retained copy of every executed Partner Portal Agreement.
--
-- The acceptance itself has been recorded since the cascade — who accepted,
-- against which version, which acknowledgments they asserted, when, from what
-- hashed address. What did not exist was the artefact: a document a person can
-- open, read and keep, showing the agreement as executed between two named
-- organisations. "We have a row in a table" is not a copy of an agreement.
--
-- WHY THE PDF IS GENERATED ON DEMAND AND THEN KEPT, rather than generated at
-- acceptance:
--
--   * Acceptance must not depend on a PDF renderer being up. Blocking a partner
--     at the door because a container is restarting is the wrong trade, and a
--     retry loop inside the accept path is a second failure mode on the one
--     request that must not fail.
--   * Every acceptance already recorded — including the solicitor acceptances
--     taken before this feature existed — gets a record the first time anyone
--     asks for one. Generating only at acceptance would have left those with
--     nothing, permanently.
--   * The document is reproducible from data that is already immutable: the
--     terms version's text and hash, and the acceptance row. The only volatile
--     input is the white-label branding, which is why it is snapshotted into
--     the row the first time the record is generated and reused afterwards.
--
-- So the first request renders and stores; every later request serves the same
-- stored bytes. The file is never regenerated over the top of itself — a
-- partner and the Command Centre must be able to hold the same document.
