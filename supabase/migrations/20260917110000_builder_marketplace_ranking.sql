-- ============================================================================
-- The marketplace draws the network's ranking (Builders Network Phase 7, wave 6).
--
-- `list_stock` ordered by `created_at DESC`. In a multi-vendor marketplace that
-- is not the absence of a ranking, it IS one: it ranks by upload recency, it
-- rewards whichever builder touched their stock list last, no builder can be
-- told their position, and no operator can account for it. The Builders Network
-- now scores every builder and every property and publishes the answer; this
-- migration is the half that receives it and lays out a page from it.
--
-- WHY THE CLONE COMPUTES NOTHING. A clone's mirror is a PARTIAL view of the
-- market — the stock of the builders this workspace is connected to, and no
-- others. A clone that scored builders for itself would not merely disagree
-- with its siblings, it would be wrong: it would be ranking builders against a
-- cohort with most of the market missing. So the score arrives on
-- `stock.item.upserted` and is stored; nothing here recomputes it and nothing
-- here may.
--
-- WHAT THE CLONE DOES OWN is the shape of a PAGE, and that division is the
-- whole design. A score is a statement about a builder. How many of one
-- builder's properties may run consecutively before another appears, how many
-- promoted slots a list offers, where a pinned property lands once an offset is
-- applied — those are properties of the surface doing the paginating, and
-- folding them into a score would make a builder's position depend on who else
-- happened to be on the page with them. The page rule is identical in every
-- deployment because this file is.
--
-- THREE RULES BITE.
--
--   AN UNRANKED ROW SORTS AS IT ALWAYS DID. Every mirror row predates this
--   migration and carries no rank until the network's next run reaches it. A
--   NULL band must therefore not collapse to zero (which would put every
--   unranked property at the top) nor to the worst band (which would bury a
--   whole catalogue the moment this shipped). `ranked_band` resolves NULL to
--   the neutral band and the tie-break falls back to `created_at DESC` — so a
--   deployment that receives no rank at all behaves exactly as it did
--   yesterday. Absent is never zero, again.
--
--   THE CAP IS A SORT, NEVER A FILTER. The interleave is a window function over
--   the ordered set, so a builder with forty properties still has all forty in
--   the list — further down it. Nothing in this migration can remove a property
--   from the marketplace. The one exception is `placement_kind = 'suppressed'`,
--   which is an operator's recorded act taken on the network with a reason and
--   an expiry, not a conclusion the ordering reached by itself.
--
--   A BOUGHT OR PINNED POSITION IS LABELLED. `disclose` crosses with the rank
--   and the card draws a chip from it. An adviser reading this list recommends
--   what is on it to a client, so anything whose position was decided by
--   something other than merit says so where they read it.

 * first takes the best three of every builder, then the next three of every
 * builder, and so on. A builder with forty properties and a rival with two
 * still shows all forty — the rival's two simply appear on page one rather than
 * after everything. Deterministic, stable under pagination, and a pure sort.
 *
 * `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_PER_BUILDER` is 3 and is stated in one place per side:
 * here, and in `marketplaceOrder.pure.ts` for the pin splice. A spec reads
 * both and fails when they drift, because two numbers that must agree and are
 * written twice is how a page comes to be laid out two different ways.

 * WHY THIS IS NOT AN EDIT TO `builder_network_apply_inbound_events`.
 *
 * That function is the clone's convergence sweep: seventeen kilobytes of
 * monotonic version guards, organisation checks, refusal bookkeeping and
 * catalogue reconciliation, with its own header explaining each. Adding two
 * lines to it means either restating the whole thing in this file — which is
 * how two copies of one sweep come to exist and then to differ — or patching
 * the deployed text by string replacement, which was tried here first and
 * refused: the anchor it needed is not in the deployed body at all, so the
 * "fix" would have been a migration that silently did nothing on the very
 * deployment it was written against.
 *
 * So the rank converges in a sweep of its own, reading the same events after
 * they have landed. It is idempotent (each event is stamped once), monotonic
 * (a replayed or out-of-order event cannot wind a card back), and it holds the
 * same rule the main sweep holds: the connection's mapped organisation is the
 * authority, and a payload claiming another builder's stock is refused.
