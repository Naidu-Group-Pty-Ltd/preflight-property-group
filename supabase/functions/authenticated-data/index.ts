/**
 * Cookie-authenticated data gateway (ES256 remediation).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `_shared/jwt.ts` mints HS256 tokens signed with `JWT_SECRET`. Both Supabase
 * projects moved to ES256 signing keys (JWKS publishes ES256; the HS256 key is
 * `previously_used`), so those tokens are rejected. The browser therefore holds
 * no usable RLS token, `clientForToken(null)` sends no Authorization header at
 * all, and every direct PostgREST query from the 16 affected modules runs as
 * `anon` against tables whose RLS is enabled — silently returning empty instead
 * of failing.
 *
 * The fix is not to re-sign tokens. It is to stop the browser needing one: the
 * browser keeps its existing secure custom-session cookie, and protected reads
 * and writes come through here, where the session is verified and authority is
 * resolved server-side.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * It is not a generic service-role proxy. A generic proxy would hand every
 * caller full service-role authority and delete RLS as a control. Instead each
 * table is listed explicitly below with the authority rule that its RLS policy
 * already expresses, and anything not listed is refused. Adding a table here is
 * a deliberate, reviewable act.
 *
 * ## The rules, taken from the live policies
 *
 *   - module permission  -> `requireModulePermission`, the same primitive every
 *     other Edge Function uses. Mirrors `current_user_can_view/edit/delete(...)`.
 *   - owner scoped       -> a mandatory server-side filter on the owning column,
 *     appended to whatever the caller sent. PostgREST ANDs repeated filters, so
 *     a caller cannot widen it.
 *   - staff role         -> membership of `user_roles` in the named roles.
 *
 * ## Deliberately excluded
 *
 *   - `email_copilot_emails`: its SELECT policy is a four-branch predicate over
 *     `clients.created_by`, `created_by`, `owner_user_id`, `mailbox_source` and
 *     null-ness. Reproducing that as filters would be an approximation, and an
 *     approximation of an access rule is a security defect. It stays on its
 *     existing path until it is modelled properly.
 *   - `agency_agreements`: RLS is enabled with ZERO policies, so it is deny-all
 *     except service-role. Routing it through here would silently grant access
 *     that no policy ever authorised. It needs an intended rule first.
