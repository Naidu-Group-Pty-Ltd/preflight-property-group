/**
 * Public transport near a property, measured from its own coordinate.
 *
 * ## What this used to do
 *
 * Kept on record because it is the clearest example of the fabrication class
 * this platform removed: eight per-state "fetchers" that **ignored the
 * coordinate entirely** and returned a hard-coded landmark list. Every NSW
 * property, wherever it stood, was 450m from Central Station with the T1-T8
 * lines; every VIC property 250m from a Swanston Street tram; and so on for
 * all eight states and territories, each with an invented `qualityScore` and
 * a summary reading "Excellent public transport access". The result was
 * cached for 30 days (`transport_data_cache` held 639 rows at removal; not
 * one live) and flowed into `location-intelligence-service`, where the
 * invented `qualityScore` drove up to 30 points of every report's walk score
 * and "Nearest Station: Central Station" was printed on properties hundreds
 * of kilometres from it. A `generateFallbackData` beneath it invented a
 * DIFFERENT answer ("Unknown", 999m, score 25) for the error path.
 *
 * It has answered `sourceUnavailable` since that removal. This is the real
 * source: `transport_stops`, loaded from each operator's own published GTFS
 * feed by `transport-gtfs-ingest`.
 *
 * ## The rule that governs an empty answer
 *
 * **A stop found is a fact about the area; no stop found is a fact about the
 * FEEDS.** Four networks are loaded and nothing else, so a Perth property is
 * not badly served — it is outside every feed this platform holds, and
 * "no stops nearby" about it would be the confident-answer-against-nothing
 * failure removed twice already. `outside_loaded_networks` and
 * `none_within_radius` are therefore different answers and this never
 * collapses them; the first is returned as `no_data_for_location` naming the
 * networks that ARE held.
 *
 * ## No score, and no mode
 *
 * Nothing here returns a rating, grade or `qualityScore`. The invented one is
 * exactly what corrupted the walk score, and a score computed from stop
 * counts alone would be a new invention wearing the same clothes: a stop
 * whose service is hourly counts the same as one served every four minutes,
 * and frequency is not measured. Mode is absent for the same reason
 * (`route_type` is NULL on every row loaded), and `notMeasured` says both in
 * words a report can print.
