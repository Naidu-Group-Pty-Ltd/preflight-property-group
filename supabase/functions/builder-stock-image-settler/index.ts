/**
 * Builder stock — bringing stock that is ALREADY imported up to the current
 * image rules, with nobody watching.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Changing what counts as a property's primary image makes
 * every previously stored image row out of date by definition: it proves where
 * its bytes came from and says nothing about what the source presented them as.
 * The repair that fixes that has existed for a while and was only ever reachable
 * through a "Source images" button in the Builder Portal, one stock list at a
 * time. Asking a builder to press a button on every source they have ever
 * uploaded is not a deployment step; it is a defect with instructions.
 *
 * So this drives the SAME repair from pg_cron. It is a sweep, not a service:
 * every upload carries a settled-version marker, this brings the ones below
 * the current version up to it, and when none are left the migration's cron
 * job unschedules itself. Nothing here is on a read path and nothing runs when
 * there is no work.
 *
 * IT NOW CARRIES THREE KINDS OF WORK, UNDER THREE MARKERS. Provenance
 * (`source_images_settled_version`) is where a row's bytes came from and what
 * the source designated them as. Marketplace display eligibility
 * (`marketplace_eligibility_settled_version`) is whether the picture itself may
 * go on a card — a facade under a status ribbon answers every provenance
 * question correctly and is still not a card image. They are versioned apart on
 * purpose: improving the classifier must not re-fetch every Notion page, and
 * re-reading a source must not re-run a classifier that has not changed. An
 * upload behind on either is outstanding, and every upload written before the
 * fourth question existed is behind on the second one — which is what makes
 * this the thing that repairs production, with nobody pressing anything.
 *
 * AND A THIRD: THE OVERLAY REPAIR (`image_sanitization_settled_version`). Where
 * the display gate refused a picture for carrying a promotional graphic laid
 * over it, the graphic is taken off the builder's OWN file and the result is
 * stored once, beside the original, as a versioned derivative. It is on its own
 * marker for the same reason the other two are: a better repair must not
 * re-fetch every source, and a better classifier must not re-run every repair.
 * It is by far the most expensive of the three and is capped hardest.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY WRITE. `builder_stock_item_images` rows, the display verdict and
 * the derivative record inside their `source_detail`, sanitized derivative
 * objects in the image bucket, the `primary_image_id` those rows earn, and the
 * three settlement markers. NO STORED IMAGE IS EVER REWRITTEN: eligibility
 * re-READS each object to measure it, and the overlay repair writes a NEW
 * object and leaves the builder's file, its hashes and its provenance exactly
 * as they are. No picture is replaced by another picture — not a map, not a
 * street view, not a search result, not stock imagery, not another property. No stock item is created or
 * deleted; no price, availability, configuration, status, selection, builder or
 * project/unit linkage is touched. Those guarantees are `repairSourceImages.ts`'s
 * and are not restated here — this only decides WHICH uploads it runs for.
 *
 * AND ONE THING THAT IS NOT A SWEEP AT ALL: `preview_sanitization`, which
 * produces a repair candidate for one image and hands back the PNG without
 * writing anything anywhere. It lives here because this is the function that
 * already holds the worker credential and already refuses every caller that is
 * not internally signed; it exists because the generative route's model is
 * behind a deployment secret, so before it the only way to SEE a candidate was
 * to let production write one over a picture a client was already being shown.
 * See `previewSanitization.ts`.
 *
 * SECURITY. Internal callers only, through the signed envelope
 * (`verifyInternal`). It holds a service-role client and crosses organisations,
 * which is exactly why it must not be reachable by a portal session. The
 * preview is behind that same gate and adds no other way in.
