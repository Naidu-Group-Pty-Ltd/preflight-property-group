/**
 * Didit webhook receiver — the ONLY inbound path that may settle a hosted
 * identity verification.
 *
 * ## Why this function has no JWT
 *
 * `verify_jwt = false`, because Didit's servers call it and cannot hold a
 * Supabase JWT. The HMAC signature IS the authentication boundary, and it is
 * treated as one: the raw body is verified before a single service-role query
 * runs, an unsigned or stale request never reaches the database, and no request
 * that fails verification can move AML state by any route. Registered as
 * `webhook-secret` in SECURITY_REGISTRY.json for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Why the webhook body is not the decision
 *
 * The payload carries a `decision` object and it is deliberately ignored. A
 * shared secret proves the event is real; it does not make the body a safe
 * source for an identity outcome. So the signature admits the event, and the
 * authoritative decision is then read back from Didit over an authenticated
 * server-to-server call. The body supplies exactly one thing: which session to
 * go and ask about.
 *
 * ## Crash safety
 *
 * The event row is recorded BEFORE processing and marked `processed_at` only
 * after the outcome is applied. A delivery that crashes between the two is
 * re-processed on retry rather than short-circuited as a replay — the failure
 * mode of "dedupe first, process second", which silently drops the outcome and
 * strands the customer. Re-processing is safe because the settling UPDATE in
 * `applyDiditDecision` is conditional on the row still being unsettled, so an
 * attempt can never be consumed twice however many times this runs.

/**
 * Is this event a persisted STANDALONE request, and which check is it about?
 *
 * ## Why `provider_reference` alone could not answer this
 *
 * `standaloneVerification.ts` writes `provider_reference = id.requestId` — the
 * **ID Verification** request id, and only at settlement. The other two
 * persisted requests live in
 * `outcome_detail.standalone.provider_request_ids.{passive_liveness,face_match}`.
 * So a Face Match `status.updated` matched nothing at all, and an ID event
 * racing the sequence arrived before the column was written.
 *
 * ## What is used instead
 *
 * `metadata.npc_verification_check_id` — a value NPC itself supplied on the
 * request and Didit echoes back, inside a body whose HMAC has already been
 * verified. It identifies the check from the first call onwards, so it does
 * not race the sequence.
 *
 * This is **classification only**. Nothing here settles, and the row is
 * returned solely so the event can be recorded against it and acknowledged.
 * The provider check is what makes that safe: a hosted row can never be
 * reached through this path, so this cannot become a second way to settle one.
 *
 * `vendor_data` and the stored request ids are checked when they are
 * available, and recorded when they disagree — but never required. Requiring
 * them would fail exactly the early-arrival case this exists to handle, and
 * since the outcome is "acknowledge and do nothing", a mismatch cannot harm a
 * customer. It is a diagnostic, not a gate.
