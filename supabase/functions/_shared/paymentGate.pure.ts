/**
 * The activation gate, as this workspace sees it.
 *
 * ## This module interprets an answer; it does not make one
 *
 * Mission Control decides whether a workspace is open, and it is the only
 * thing that can: it holds the payment, the operator's overrides and the
 * clock. Re-deriving the verdict here from raw facts would be a second
 * implementation of the same rule in a place that can be edited independently,
 * and two implementations of "may this customer work" is exactly the drift
 * this platform cannot afford. So the transport carries a decided `status`,
 * and everything below is about reading it safely.
 *
 * ## Every failure is OPEN
 *
 * A missing key, an unreachable Mission Control, a 500, a body that will not
 * parse, a reason word this build has never heard of — all of them resolve to
 * an open workspace. That is not laxity, it is where the enforcement lives:
 * Mission Control itself refuses a locked clone's token and seat reservations
 * with 402, so a workspace that talks its way past this screen still cannot
 * spend Aurixa's money. What this screen can do that the server cannot is lock
 * out a PAYING customer over a network blip, and that is the failure worth
 * designing against.
 *
 * Parses under Deno: no `@/` aliases, explicit `.ts` extensions. The browser
 * reaches it through `src/lib/paymentGate/state.ts`.
