/**
 * Project a stored `investment_reports.financial_calculations` into the binding
 * vocabulary a 10 Year Cash Flow template uses.
 *
 * ## This format has no table of its own, and that is the first thing to know
 *
 * The other four formats on the family system each read a stored artefact:
 * `investment_reports`, `borrowing_capacity_assessments`,
 * `portfolio_analysis_reports`, `property_comparisons`. This one has
 * **`cash_flow_analyses`, which holds 0 rows**, and `cash_flow_renders`, which
 * is a render ledger carrying no payload.
 *
 * `docs/reports/CASH_FLOW.md` explains why, and it is by design rather than by
 * neglect: `CashFlowAnalysisModal` lets an adviser override any of ten fields in
 * any of ten years, live, and those overrides are never persisted. The
 * arithmetic is the browser's and it is thrown away.
 *
 * So a template rendered from a report **id** — which is all an adapter is
 * given — cannot show the projection an adviser reviewed, because that
 * projection was never written down. What it can show is the one the report
 * itself stores, and 162 of the 1,182 investment reports carry exactly that:
 * `financial_calculations.projections`, three scenarios of ten years each, all
 * 4,860 elements complete, every one carrying the same eight numeric fields.
 *
 * The 1,020 reports without it are not an error and are not rendered blank —
 * `cashFlowAdapter` returns null and the legacy generator keeps them.
 *
 * ## Four figures in this record contradict the series, and none is published
 *
 * This is the whole design of the module, so it is stated once here in full.
 * Everything below was measured across all 162 stored reports.
 *
 * **1. `keyMetrics.annualNet` / `weeklyNet`.** Both are year-one annual cash
 * flow, exactly what `projections.moderate[0].cashFlow` is. They differ by a
 * **median of $24,793**, the projection being the more negative on 148 of the
 * 162, and they agree exactly on **none**. Neither equals
 * `annualRent - annualCosts.totalAnnual - monthlyPayment * 12`. They are two
 * independent computations and nothing reconciles them. A page with one in a
 * KPI and the other in the year-one row of the table beneath it contradicts
 * itself by $25,000, and a reader has no way to tell which to believe.
 *
 * **2. `initialCosts.propertyValue`.** Sound on 160 reports. On one it is
 * **$3**, while that same report's deposit is $150,000, its loan $600,000 and
 * its own year-one projected value $780,000. The series carries the value on
 * every report and is the subject of this document, so the value is read from
 * the series and never from the input.
 *
 * **3. `initialCosts.totalUpfront`.** Equals the sum of the initial costs
 * beside it on **29 of 161**. The residual runs from −$80,740 to +$93,000,
 * because the total is computed from the real deposit (price less loan) while
 * the `deposit` field is a percentage of price, and the two disagree whenever
 * the LVR is not the deposit's complement.
 *
 * **4. `annualCosts.totalAnnual`.** Equals the sum of its own components on
 * **18 of 162** (21 within $100). Residual −$25,020 to +$14,003, and it is
 * exactly 0 on 13 reports whose components are not.
 *
 * A total printed under the figures it is supposed to total, wrong by up to
 * $93,000, is worse than no total: it tells the reader the document cannot add
 * up, and there is no way for them to know which line is at fault. So the
 * components are published and the totals are not. `cashFlowCatalogue.spec.ts`
 * asserts no master binds them, because the natural instinct when laying out a
 * cost table is to add a total row.
 *
 * Two more are omitted for a related reason.
 *
 * **`loanDetails.interestOnlyPeriod`** is 2 years on the 93 reports that carry
 * it, but the projected loan balance falls in year one on **all 161** — 0.988
 * of the original on every report, in every scenario. The series does not model
 * the interest-only period. Stating it beside a balance column that amortises
 * from year one would put a contradiction on the page.
 *
 * **The whole `assumptions` object** — `capitalGrowth`, `cpiGrowth`,
 * `occupancyWeeks` — describes something other than the series stored beside
 * it. Measured across all 162:
 *
 *  - The three scenarios are built at **exactly 2%, 4% and 6% capital growth
 *    and 2%, 3% and 4% rental growth**, identically on every report. Not
 *    approximately: `(value₁₀/value₁)^(1/9)` is 2.000, 4.000 and 6.000 on all
 *    162, to three decimal places.
 *  - `assumptions.capitalGrowth` is recorded on 69 of them, runs 0 to 26.6 with
 *    a median of 5.0, and equals the 4% the moderate series was built at on
 *    **3**.
 *  - `assumptions.cpiGrowth` is recorded on 16 and equals the rental growth the
 *    series used on 2 of the 48 scenario-series those reports carry.
 *  - `income.weeklyRent × assumptions.occupancyWeeks` equals year-one rent on
 *    **none** of them.
 *
 * A page headed "what this rests on" that states 5.2% growth beside a table
 * built at 4% is worse than one that states nothing: it is a specific, checkable
 * claim about the document's own arithmetic, and it is false. So the recorded
 * assumptions are not published, and `basis` below is derived from the series
 * instead — which makes it a restatement of the numbers on the page rather than
 * a second opinion about them.
 *
 * ## Units, measured across all 4,860 elements
 *
 *  - `year` 1-10, on all three scenarios of all 162 reports.
 *  - `propertyValue` $438,600-$2,149,017, `loanBalance` $293,642-$949,586,
 *    `equity` $37,342-$1,329,551, `annualRent` $0-$103,104 — dollars.
 *  - `cashFlow` −$96,910 to +$2,562, and **negative on 4,856 of the 4,860**:
 *    all four exceptions are in the optimistic scenario. `cumulativeCashFlow`
 *    −$932,328 to −$12,269, negative on every element without exception. That is
 *    what the data says; the pages label it as a shortfall rather than dressing
 *    it up.
 *  - `roi` −122.24 to 88.34 — whole-number percent, like every other rate in
 *    this codebase. The `percent` filter does not multiply.
 *  - The scenarios are strictly ordered — conservative < moderate < optimistic
 *    at year ten on all 162 — so naming them is meaningful rather than
 *    decorative.
 *
 * `projections.annualRent` equals neither `income.weeklyRent * 52` nor
 * `weeklyRent * assumptions.occupancyWeeks` on any report, so the weekly rent is
 * not published beside the series either. It would read as the figure the series
 * was built from, and it is not.
 *
 * ## There is no client on this record
 *
 * `investment_reports` has **no `client_name` column at all**, and
 * `client_property_id` is set on **2 of the 162**. So this format is addressed
 * to a property rather than to a person: no `client` namespace is published,
 * and the masters lead on `cashflow.property.address` — present, and at most 67
 * characters, on all 162.
