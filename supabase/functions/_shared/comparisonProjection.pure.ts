/**
 * Project a stored `property_comparisons` row into the binding vocabulary a
 * Property Comparison template uses.
 *
 * ## This one does not normalise anything, and that is the point
 *
 * The other three projections in this directory read a stored row directly,
 * because their formats had no normaliser to share. This format does:
 * `_shared/reports/propertyComparison/normalise.pure.ts` already turns a row —
 * of either storage shape — into a `PropertyComparison`, and
 * `docs/reports/COMPARISON.md` records what it took to get right. Writing a
 * second reader would mean a second answer to every one of those questions:
 *
 *  - **27 of the 50 stored rows have all seven jsonb columns NULL**, with the
 *    model's truncated raw response in `executive_summary`. `salvage.pure.ts`
 *    recovers them without ever repairing a cut-off array, which is what stops
 *    a half-written ranking reaching a client's page looking whole.
 *  - **`finalScore` is on two scales.** 17 comparisons score 0-100 and 6 score
 *    0-10, and the 0-10 group runs to the most recent row in the table, so it
 *    is not a legacy tail. `detectScale` decides once per comparison and
 *    reports whether it is confident.
 *  - **A winner pointer of `0` or `null` means "nobody".** Of the 253 pointers
 *    across the eleven superlatives, 210 name a property, 15 are `0` and 28 are
 *    `null` — 17% naming no one. `propertyAt` returns null rather than reading
 *    `properties[-1]`.
 *
 * So this module is a restatement, not a reader. Everything below takes the
 * normalised model and gives its fields the names a template binds. If a
 * question about the data has an answer, it is answered upstream and both
 * renderers get the same one.
 *
 * ## What it publishes, and what stays absent
 *
 * A comparison carries no deterministic figures at all — every field was
 * written by a model in a single response. The one number, `finalScore`, is
 * published with its denominator beside it (`ranked.0.outOf`) rather than as a
 * bare figure, because 8.5 means two different things on the two scales.
 *
 * `marketTiming` and `competitiveAdvantages` are published where they exist,
 * which is **only on the damaged rows**: the writer that destructures a
 * successful response into seven columns has no column for them and drops them.
 * A salvaged document carries more of the analysis than an intact one. (This
 * paragraph was aspiration for a while — the code below dropped both on the
 * floor until the binding audit compared it against the payload. They are
 * published now, with the truncation note beside them, because half the stored
 * rows are salvaged and `recommendations` is absent on all but two of those —
 * a verdict page that binds only the pick renders an empty display-size
 * heading on 25 of the 50 rows in production.)
