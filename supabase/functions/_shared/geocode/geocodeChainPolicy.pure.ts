/**
 * What the chain may REMEMBER, and when it must stop ASKING.
 *
 * `geocoder.ts` does the asking; the decisions are here so they can be tested
 * without a network, because the ones that failed on 24 Sep 2026 were
 * decisions, not I/O.
 *
 * ## The fault: an outage became an address's permanent answer
 *
 * From 07:51:29 UTC the public Nominatim answered HTTP 403 to every request
 * from the production egress. The chain did what it was built to do — it fell
 * through to the ABS suburb centroid — and then did what it was ALSO built to
 * do: it wrote that centroid into `geocode_cache`, whose rule is "a hit is the
 * answer; nothing expires, because an address does not move". So
 * `1408/5 SECOND AVE, Blacktown NSW 2148` and `93 Schofields Farm Road,
 * Schofields NSW 2762` were filed, permanently, as the middle of Blacktown and
 * the middle of Schofields. Regenerating either report — or waiting for the
 * refusal to lift — could never have placed them again.
 *
 * The rule the cache had was right for the answer it was written for. A
 * suburb centroid taken because the finer providers LOOKED and found no such
 * street is the best this address is going to get, and remembering it is
 * exactly what the public services ask of us. A suburb centroid taken because
 * the finer providers COULD NOT BE ASKED is not an answer about the address at
 * all — it is a statement about our access that day.
 *
 * ## Three rules
 *
 * 1. **An answer coarser than a street, taken while a finer provider could not
 *    be asked, is served and never remembered** (`cacheVerdict`).
 * 2. **A remembered answer coarser than a street is provisional.** Where the
 *    question names a street and a finer provider is configured, it is asked
 *    again once it is older than `FLOOR_REASK_AFTER_MS`; a finer answer
 *    replaces it, a finer "no such address" re-dates it, and a finer outage
 *    leaves it standing (`cachedAnswerIsProvisional`). That is what repairs
 *    the rows the outage already wrote, with no migration and no row deleted
 *    by hand.
 * 3. **A refusal pauses the provider** (`pauseAfterRefusal`). A 403 or 429 is
 *    the service telling us to stop; asking again every thirty seconds — which
 *    is what a report's continuations did — is how a block is earned and how
 *    one is extended. The refusal's own words are kept for the log
 *    (`refusalExcerpt`), because on the day it mattered nobody could say WHY
 *    the service had refused us.
 *
 * Pure: no Deno, no DOM, no network.
