/**
 * The Standalone identity verification sequence.
 *
 * One customer submission → three billed provider calls → one canonical
 * `aml.verification_checks` outcome. This module owns the order, the money and
 * the settlement; it is the only place any of the three is decided.
 *
 * ## Where it runs
 *
 * Server-side only, and never inside the request that the customer is waiting
 * on. Two callers, one implementation:
 *
 *   - `aml-verification-processor`, invoked directly by the portal the moment a
 *     submission is accepted (so the wait is seconds) and by pg_cron as the
 *     watchdog (so a killed isolate does not strand anybody);
 *   - `cross-portal-outbox-worker`, if the durable `aml.verification.requested`
 *     event is ever driven.
 *
 * All three race safely, because every one of them has to win the same
 * conditional claim before it can spend a cent.
 *
 * ## The rule that shapes everything else: these calls cost money
 *
 * Didit bills per 200 response and publishes no idempotency key —
 * `vendor_data` is documented as an opaque correlation string and explicitly
 * NOT as one. Three consequences run through this file:
 *
 *  1. **One owner per attempt.** `claimCheck` is a conditional UPDATE from a
 *     queued state to `processing`. A double-click, a second tab, a re-fired
 *     cron sweep and a redelivered outbox event all lose it and walk away, so
 *     the sequence runs at most once per submission.
 *  2. **Nothing here ever throws to trigger a retry.** The outbox machinery
 *     retries a throwing consumer with exponential backoff up to ten times.
 *     For a free consumer that is correct; for this one it would be ten
 *     unattended purchases of the same verification. Every failure is recorded
 *     on the row and the function returns normally. The retry is a human or a
 *     fresh customer submission — a controlled one.
 *  3. **An ambiguous timeout stops the sequence.** A request that left and
 *     whose response never arrived has an unknown billing state. It is recorded
 *     as `timeout` with `billing_unknown`, it consumes no attempt, and nothing
 *     re-sends it.
 *
 * ## What the customer's allowance is spent on
 *
 * Only an authoritative examination. `canonicalOutcome` — shared with the
 * self-hosted path and the staff re-run — is the single place that decides,
 * and it consumes nothing for a capture the provider could not examine. Every
 * technical condition on this path lands in `processing_status` +
 * `provider_error_category` and leaves `status` alone.

 * `resolveReferenceImage` extracted the document portrait on every run and
 * deliberately discarded it — it lived in one local variable and was never
 * persisted. So every verification completed before that changed has a
 * Compliance Passport with no face on it, even though the document page it
 * was cropped from is still in NPC's own bucket.
 *
 * That is a defect in this product's own record-keeping, and repairing it is
 * this product's job. **Asking an operator to click a button on each case is
 * asking them to fix our bug by hand**, once per customer, for ever — and it
 * makes a Passport's completeness depend on whether anybody happened to open
 * it. The one-minute sweep that already exists finds these and fills them in.
 *
 * ── What it is, precisely ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * **It re-derives an IMAGE. It never re-decides an identity.** The check's
 * status, verdict, thresholds, scores and `completed_at` are not read here
 * and not written: the verification stands exactly as it was recorded, and
 * the only things this adds to the row are
 * `standalone_capture.objects.id_portrait` and the attempt stamp beside it.
 * A re-read that disagrees with the recorded verdict is returned for the
 * caller to log and acted on by nobody — silently adopting a second opinion
 * nobody asked for would be far worse than the missing photograph.
 *
 * ── Exactly one attempt, ever ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * This makes one billed ID-verification call, and the stamp it leaves is
 * written whether the call succeeded, failed or produced nothing. The stamp's
 * PRESENCE is the guard, never its outcome: retrying a paid call against the
 * same unreadable document would spend every minute for ever, which is the
 * unattended spending the processor above this refuses by design. A record
 * that cannot be repaired settles as `unavailable` on the page and stays
 * there.
