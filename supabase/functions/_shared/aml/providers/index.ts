/**
 * AML provider orchestration (Phase 6 upgrade).
 *
 * Tri-mode isolation:
 *   - "simulator": deterministic, no external calls (default, safe for tests).
 *   - "live":      real external provider adapters. If a requested provider is
 *                  not wired, the factory THROWS (never silently falls back to
 *                  simulator) so that a live-mode misconfiguration surfaces
 *                  loudly instead of producing a false-pass.
 *
 * Mode is resolved per capability using (in priority order):
 *   1. `provider_configs.mode` for the tenant's active provider (if `admin` client passed).
 *   2. Env override: `AML_PROVIDER_MODE` = "simulator" | "live".
 *   3. Default: "simulator".
 *
 * Providers MUST NEVER be selected client-side. Callers pass a hint only;
 * the shared factory + tenant configuration decide.
