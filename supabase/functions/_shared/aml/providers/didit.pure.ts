/**
 * Didit hosted-session IDV: status vocabulary, required-feature validation,
 * correlation and sanitisation.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free, because everything that matters about this
 * provider is a decision about someone's identity made from a payload we did
 * not write, and all of it has to be testable without the network.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists at all
 *
 * The self-hosted provider hands us a shape we designed. Didit does not: the
 * V3 contract was read off the live account rather than remembered, and three
 * things about it would each have produced a wrong answer if assumed.
 *
 *  1. **The feature results are ARRAYS.** `id_verifications`, `liveness_checks`
 *     and `face_matches` are plural, and `null` until the workflow has run that
 *     feature at least once. Reading `decision.face_match.status` — the obvious
 *     shape, and the V2 one — yields `undefined`, which is exactly the value a
 *     naive mapper turns into a pass.
 *  2. **The feature is named differently at the two layers.** The workflow node
 *     is `OCR`; the session reports `ID_VERIFICATION`. A required-feature check
 *     written against the workflow vocabulary matches nothing on the decision.
 *  3. **Feature status and session status share words but not a vocabulary.**
 *     A feature is one of `Not Finished | Approved | Declined | In Review`; a
 *     session adds `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Awaiting User`, `Expired`,
 *     `Abandoned`, `Kyc Expired`, `Resubmitted`. Collapsing them loses the
 *     distinction between "the customer walked away" and "we examined them and
 *     said no", which is the difference between a free retry and a consumed
 *     attempt.
 *
 * ## The rule the whole module serves
 *
 * NPC requires ID Verification, Face Match 1:1 and Passive Liveness. An
 * `Approved` session whose required evidence is absent, unexecuted or
 * unreadable is NOT a pass — it is a referral. Unknown never becomes passed.

/**
 * The opaque identifier Didit stores as `vendor_data`.
 *
 * Deliberately built from internal identifiers only. Didit groups sessions by
 * `vendor_data`, so it is durable, cross-session, and visible in their console
 * — putting a name, an email, a document number or a date of birth here would
 * export customer PII into a field whose whole purpose is to be shared and
 * retained. `npc:<case-id>:<party-id|primary>:<attempt>` correlates exactly as
 * well and discloses nothing.
 *
 * ## The hosted session is keyed on the PERSON, and the attempt is omitted
 *
 * `POST /v3/session/` is not a create — it is an upsert keyed on
 * `workflow_id + vendor_data`. Re-measured against the live API on 2026-08-14:
 * two creates with the same pair returned byte-identical `session_id`,
 * `session_token`, `url` and `session_number`, and merely overwrote
 * `metadata`.
 *
 * Didit groups sessions into a Directory user BY that exact string — so the
 * suffix decides whether one applicant is one person or several in the
 * provider's console. Measured on this account: case `8c58cc07…` produced TWO
 * Directory users, `npc:8c58cc07…:primary` and `npc:8c58cc07…:primary:3`,
 * because the key carried the attempt. The hosted flow therefore mints the
 * three-part, person-scoped form and `attempt` is left off:
 *
 *   - one NPC applicant is one Didit user, and every session they ever run
 *     aggregates under it (Verifications → User Verifications, Directory →
 *     Users);
 *   - the upsert becomes the outermost duplicate-charge guard, because a
 *     refresh, a double-click or a second tab all return the SAME unstarted
 *     session rather than buying another.
 *
 * The cost of that choice is recorded honestly: a key that no longer varies
 * cannot force a fresh session, so the `workflow_revised_at` guard can release
 * NPC's row but cannot re-mint under a new configuration while the provider's
 * session is still alive (7 days, `session_expiration_time`). A settled or
 * expired session is replaced normally. That is a deliberate trade of
 * reconfiguration latency for provider-side identity, and it is the trade the
 * Directory requirement asks for.
 *
 * `attempt` is still ACCEPTED on the way in — sessions minted under the
 * four-part form are live for seven days and their decisions must still
 * correlate. See `parseVendorData`.
