/**
 * The digital passport booklet — page composition.
 *
 * The design builds the booklet from a small block vocabulary
 * (`PassportPage.dc.html`): a page is a kicker, a title, a subtitle and an
 * ordered list of blocks. This module is the production equivalent — it turns
 * one `PassportView` into that page list.
 *
 * It is pure and lives beside the other Passport derivations for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. **The booklet must not be able to disagree with the register.** Both are
 *     built from the same projection, so a figure printed on paper and the same
 *     figure in the Command pages come from one source. A booklet that fetched
 *     its own data would eventually print something the register denies.
 *  2. **Page composition is logic, not markup, and belongs under test.** Which
 *     pages exist depends on what the case actually holds; the design's own
 *     screenshots show 12, 14 and 16 pages for the same document. Getting that
 *     wrong prints a blank page or silently drops a section, and neither is
 *     visible from a component test that renders one fixture.
 *
 * A page whose records do not exist is NOT emitted. The booklet never prints a
 * page that says nothing — an empty "Screening" leaf in a bound document reads
 * as "screening found nothing", which is a different and much worse claim than
 * "screening is not part of this record".

/* ── reading it ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `bookletGeometry` answers "how large can this document be drawn in the
 * space available". That is a fitting question, and it has one answer.
 *
 * It is not the same question as "how large does this reader need it".
 * The design authors a leaf at 470x648 with 9.5-11px body copy, so a spread
 * fitted into a dialog on a laptop renders that copy at 6-7px — legible in
 * the sense that the glyphs are distinct, and unreadable in the sense that
 * nobody reads it. The document was reported as "the wording on the pages
 * is not clearly visible", which is exactly right and is not a fault in the
 * fit: the fit is correct and the page is simply too small for a person.
 *
 * So the reader gets a magnification of their own, applied ON TOP of the
 * fit. Three rules make it safe:
 *
 *   · **Fit is still the baseline.** Zoom 1 is whatever the space allows, so
 *     every existing surface is unchanged until somebody asks for more.
 *   · **Zooming never reflows.** It multiplies the same uniform transform the
 *     fit uses, so a magnified leaf is the same drawing larger — never a
 *     narrower column with rewrapped text.
 *   · **Overflow is the caller's to scroll.** This reports the drawn size and
 *     whether it now exceeds the board, and the board pans; nothing here
 *     crops, because a passport that silently loses its margin is worse than
 *     one that scrolls.
