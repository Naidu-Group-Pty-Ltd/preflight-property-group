/**
 * Project a loaded `abs_census_poa` row into the response shapes the report
 * pipelines consume — the one place the Census vocabulary meets the
 * platform's, shared by `abs-data-service` and `abs-employment-service` and
 * under test.
 *
 * Every figure is the ABS's own or a disclosed derivation of it, and every
 * label says what it actually is:
 *
 *  - **Rates name their denominators.** "Employment rate" here is employed ÷
 *    labour force (the complement of the unemployment rate); the
 *    employment-to-population ratio is published under its own name. The
 *    fabricated predecessor blurred them, and a rate whose denominator is
 *    unstated is a number that cannot be checked.
 *  - **Annual incomes are annualised weekly medians and say so.** The Census
 *    publishes weekly medians; × 52 is a disclosed convention, not a
 *    measurement.
 *  - **Industries are sorted by measured employment**, so `topIndustries[0]`
 *    is genuinely the largest employer. The old prompt hard-coded
 *    "Professional Services" as row one for every suburb in the country.
 *  - **No growth, no outlook, no trend.** One census cannot measure change,
 *    and this module will not invent it. Absent is a field the renderer
 *    omits; it is never a guessed number.
 *  - **The reference period travels with every block.** Census figures are
 *    2021 because they are 2021 — the most current authoritative
 *    postcode-level source until the 2026 Census releases — and a label
 *    claiming otherwise is the fabrication this replaces ("ABS (2025)" on
 *    invented numbers).
 *
 * Pure: no Deno, no network, no I/O.
