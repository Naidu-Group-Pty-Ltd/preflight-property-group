/**
 * The closing page every report shares: who issued it, how to reach them, and
 * the professional disclaimer.
 *
 * There are currently **two** implementations of this page — `drawJsPDFDisclaimerPage`
 * and `drawPdfLibDisclaimerPage` in `src/utils/pdfDisclaimerPage.ts` — which
 * agree on nothing but the gold (`#BF9B50`, itself one of eight in the repo) and
 * disagree on margins, leading, the disclaimer's vertical anchor, and whether
 * the font size setting is honoured at all (jsPDF's ignores it). This module is
 * the shape both of them, and the WeasyPrint page, now derive from.
 *
 * Only the **data shaping** lives here — sanitisation, name splitting, row
 * order, the font-size table. Painting is the renderer's job, which is why this
 * module has no colours in it and works for a vector PDF library and an HTML
 * document alike.

 *
 * The rule was "everything but the last word", which is right for the
 * three-word name it was written for and wrong for a four-word one. On a real
 * tenant's closing page, `NAIDU PROPERTY CONSULTING SERVICES` set
 * `NAIDU PROPERTY CONSULTING` in gold across two display lines with `SERVICES`
 * beneath it in small letterspaced caps — which does not read as a lockup, it
 * reads as a title that ran out of room with a subtitle bolted on. It is the
 * last page of the document and it was the second thing a reader saw.
 *
 * So the lead takes as many whole words as fit on one line and the tail takes
 * the rest, however many words that is. Three-word names are unchanged, which
 * is what keeps the existing convention: `NPC PROPERTY` is 12 characters and
 * `TENANT` is 6.
