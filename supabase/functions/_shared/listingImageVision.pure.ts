/**
 * What an image *is*, decided by looking at its pixels.
 *
 * This is the one implementation of that judgement. It used to live in
 * `src/lib/imageKind.ts` and run only in a browser, only after the card had
 * already drawn, only for a session — which meant the single most important
 * decision the marketplace makes, *which photograph leads a listing*, was taken
 * with no visual information at all. A contact sheet of sixteen listings' hero
 * images, sampled at random from production on 2026-08-19, came back as:
 *
 * - **six floor plans** (37.5%),
 * - one "coming soon" text card,
 * - one stock interior render that is the hero on seventeen different listings,
 * - and eight actual photographs of the property.
 *
 * The URLs give nothing away — five of the six plans are
 * `lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/<opaque id>`, because the agency emails its
 * photographs as Google Drive links. Pixels are the only evidence there is.
 *
 * ## The thresholds are measured, not guessed
 *
 * Every number below comes from running these features over images whose
 * identity was established by eye. `white` is the fraction of near-white pixels
 * and it separates the two populations by a factor of six:
 *
 * | Kind | `white` | `colour` | `palette` |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | Floor plans (7 measured) | 0.731 – 0.955 | 0.003 – 0.051 | 20 – 105 |
 * | "Coming soon" text card | 0.512 | 0.160 | 213 |
 * | Agency banner strip | 0.000 (aspect 10.9) | 0.104 | 18 |
 * | Photographs (11 measured) | 0.000 – 0.118 | 0.000 – 0.634 | 46 – 556 |
 *
 * The gap between the worst plan (0.731) and the whitest photograph (0.118) is
 * enormous, which is why this is a threshold and not a model.
 *
 * ## The bias is deliberate and asymmetric
 *
 * Calling a plan a photograph leaves it where the agent put it — yesterday's
 * behaviour. Calling a photograph a plan buries it behind everything else. The
 * second mistake is much worse, so every rule here demands strong evidence
 * before it will say anything other than `photo`, and the overlap zone resolves
 * to `photo`.
 *
 * ## What it cannot see
 *
 * A stock interior render is a photograph by every measure here — it is one, it
 * is just not a photograph of *this* property. Nothing in a single image can
 * establish that. It takes the corpus: an image that is the hero on seventeen
 * listings is not a picture of any of them, and that is
 * `listingImageSelection.pure.ts`'s `sharedListings`, not this module's job.
 *
 * Pure: no Deno, no DOM, no imports. Takes RGBA bytes and returns numbers.
