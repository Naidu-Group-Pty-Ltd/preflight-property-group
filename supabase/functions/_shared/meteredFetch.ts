/**
 * `fetch`, with the vendor bill attached.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * This deployment may be running on API keys it does not own: a workspace
 * provisioned by Mission Control boots with the prime's OpenAI, Resend, Domain
 * and Cotality keys forwarded into its Supabase project, and Mission Control
 * recharges what it spends on them. Only calls that reach `logApiUsage` are
 * metered at all — and 92 of this repo's edge functions called a billable
 * vendor without logging anything, so most spend was invisible.
 *
 * Instrumenting 92 files by hand meant 92 chances to attribute a call to the
 * wrong credential, and a rule ("remember to log") that decays the moment
 * somebody adds function 93. This wraps the thing they were already writing
 * instead: change `fetch(` to `meteredFetch(` and the call is metered, because
 * the URL already says which credential it spends.
 *
 * DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
 *   • Never changes the response. It returns exactly what `fetch` returned,
 *     with the body unread — a metering wrapper that consumed the stream would
 *     break every caller.
 *   • Never throws its own errors. A failure to meter must not fail the call
 *     that earns the revenue.
 *   • Never blocks. The log write is fire-and-forget.
 *   • Needs no Supabase client from the caller. It builds its own service-role
 *     client lazily from the env every edge function already has, so adding
 *     metering to a call site is one identifier, not a plumbing exercise.
