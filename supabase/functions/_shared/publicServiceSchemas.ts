/**
 * WP-24: request schemas for the unauthenticated location data services.
 *
 * ## Why these five first
 *
 * `abs-employment-service`, `climate-data-service`, `crime-statistics-service`,
 * `public-transport-service` and `school-data-service` are classified `public`
 * in `SECURITY_REGISTRY.json` — no session, no cookie, reachable by anyone with
 * the publishable key that ships in the browser bundle.
 *
 * All five read their body with a bare `await req.json()` and a TypeScript type
 * *assertion*, which checks nothing at runtime. That has three consequences, in
 * increasing order of how much they matter:
 *
 *  1. A non-JSON body throws inside the try and answers 500. Noise.
 *  2. `{"state": {"$ne": null}}` reaches whatever the handler does with `state`
 *     — string interpolation into a URL, a lookup key — as an object.
 *  3. **There is no size bound.** `req.json()` will read whatever is sent. On an
 *     endpoint that needs no credentials at all, that is an unauthenticated
 *     memory-pressure vector, and it is the reason these five went first rather
 *     than the 31 `public-auth` ones behind a login.
 *
 * `parseJsonBody` from `_shared/validate.ts` fixes all three in one call,
 * because the size bound and the shape check are the same call.
 *
 * ## Shapes
 *
 * Deliberately `.strict()`. These take a locality and nothing else; an unknown
 * key is a caller sending something the endpoint does not implement, and saying
 * so is more useful than ignoring it. Bounds are generous enough that no real
 * Australian locality is rejected and small enough that none of this is a
 * payload: no suburb name is 120 characters.
