/**
 * Project a stored `investment_reports` row into the binding vocabulary the
 * seeded template catalogue actually uses.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The catalogue and the adapter disagreed about names, and nothing said so.
 * Measured against the 50 Investment Compass masters and 1,182 production
 * reports: **79 of their 80 bindings resolved to nothing**. The only survivor
 * was `property.zoning`, because that is the one key whose spelling happened to
 * match. Three independent causes:
 *
 *  - **Case.** Templates bind `property.yearBuilt`, `property.type`,
 *    `property.landArea`; `property_specs` stores `year_built`,
 *    `property_type`, `land_size_sqm`.
 *  - **Depth.** Templates bind `financials.grossYield` and
 *    `financials.weeklyRent`; the stored object nests those under
 *    `keyMetrics.grossRentalYield` and `income.weeklyRent`. The adapter's
 *    `flatten()` is `{ ...obj }` — a shallow spread that never flattened a path.
 *  - **Location.** Templates bind `property.address`; the adapter publishes it
 *    as `report.address`.
 *
 * This is why `docs/reports/COVERAGE.md` records **zero of 1,162 investment
 * reports** rendered by this system: the templates were never wrong-looking in
 * preview, because preview runs on `SAMPLE_REPORT_DATA`, which is written in
 * the catalogue's vocabulary rather than the database's.
 *
 * The projection is **additive**. Callers merge it over the raw namespaces, so
 * `property.year_built` and `financials.keyMetrics` keep working for anything
 * already bound to them.
 *
 * ## The rule this module is built on
 *
 * **Project what exists; leave absent what does not.** A key is emitted only
 * when its source is present, so an unmapped binding renders empty exactly as
 * it does today rather than printing a fabricated number. "A misread number in
 * a client's financial report is this programme's top risk" — inventing one is
 * strictly worse than leaving the line blank.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT projected, because no source exists in the row (verified
 * against production, not assumed — do not "helpfully" fill these in):
 *
 *  - `financials.breakEvenRent` — derivable in principle, but it is a NEW
 *    financial claim rather than a restatement of a stored one. It belongs in
 *    the calculator that owns the numbers, not in a display projection.
 *  - `financials.narrative`, `financials.fundingNote`, `summary.narrative`,
 *    `property.rationale` — prose with no dedicated column.
 *  - `market.*` — `location_intelligence` holds amenities, commute,
 *    coordinates, healthcare, lifestyle, schools, transport and walkScore. It
 *    carries no postcode, state, suburb count or market narrative.
 *  - `assumptions.rentalGrowth` — `assumptions` holds capitalGrowth, cpiGrowth
 *    and occupancyWeeks. CPI is not rental growth and must not stand in for it.
 *  - `assumptions.taxRate` — `cashFlow.taxRate` is null across the sample.
 *  - `assumptions.sellingCosts`, `financials.loanFees` — no source. (LMI is not
 *    a loan fee.)
 *  - `risks.N.why`, `risks.N.action`, `recommendation.rationale` —
 *    `investment_score.risks` is an array of plain **strings** and
 *    `investment_score.recommendation` is a single **string**. There is no
 *    second field to put in those columns.
 *  - `property.suburb`, `property.condition`, `property.tenancy` — no column.
 *    Suburb is parseable from the address string, and that is exactly the kind
 *    of guess that puts the wrong suburb on a client's report.
 *  - `author.*`, `client.*` — there is no `profiles` table for an adviser and
 *    no client-name column on this row (`client_property_id` is set on 2 of the
 *    1,182). The masters no longer bind either.
 *  - `property.images.*` — no adapter emits photographs; see
 *    `docs/template-library/07-investment-compass-families.md`.
 *
 * `org.*` was on that list until August 2026 and should not have been. The
 * sentence "organisation data lives outside this row" is true of the *row* and
 * was read for four months as though it meant no source existed. One does —
 * `whitelabel_settings`, the table the Branding page writes — and every adapter
 * now merges it. See `organisationProjection.pure.ts`.
 *
 * ## What the templates stopped binding
 *
 * The list above was, for most of its entries, a list of things the catalogue
 * bound anyway. Measured against a report taken verbatim from production, **49
 * of the masters' 80 paths resolved to nothing** — and an unresolved binding
 * renders as the empty string, so a page of them is a page of labels with
 * nothing beside them, not a page that looks broken.
 *
 * The masters were re-pointed rather than the projection widened, because the
 * entries above genuinely have no source and inventing one is the worse
 * outcome. Two got a real source instead:
 *
 *  - `assessment` — `investment_score.breakdown`, five weighted dimensions with
 *    a score and a `details` sentence each. It replaced a three-row risk
 *    register bound to `risks.0..2` when `risks` never holds more than one, and
 *    a narrative page whose four paragraphs all bound `market.*`.
 *  - `tenYear.equitySeries` — `financial_calculations.projections.moderate`, on
 *    162 reports. The projection page's chart bound it and nothing published
 *    it, so the one chart in the format drew an empty plot on every report.
 *
 * ## Units
 *
 * Percentages are stored as whole-number percent (gross yield 0–7.51, interest
 * rate 3.0–6.5, capital growth 0–26.6 across 400 sampled reports), and the
 * `percent` filter formats without multiplying (`6.5` → `"6.50%"`). So
 * percentages pass through untouched. Getting this backwards is a 100× error on
 * a client's financial report, which is why it was measured rather than
 * inferred.
 *
 * Weekly figures are `annual / 52` — a unit conversion, not a model. The one
 * modelled value is `annualRent`, which uses the report's own stated
 * `occupancyWeeks` rather than assuming 52.

 * ## What was missing
 *
 * Every namespace above comes from a jsonb column the calculator wrote —
 * `investment_score`, `financial_calculations`, `property_specs`. None of them
 * is the report. The report is `report_content`: the document the model writes
 * against the configured `report_structure_templates` guide, and the thing an
 * operator means by "the report structure".
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-16 on one address generated at all five tiers, the model
 * writes a full document every time —
 *
 * | tier | headings | opens with |
 * | --- | ---: | --- |
 * | `snapshot` | 9 | Property Summary |
 * | `briefing` | 39 | Location Overview |
 * | `financial` | 42 | Client Investment Decision Summary |
 * | `strategic` | 80 | Property & Location Due Diligence Report |
 * | `compass` | 107 | Executive Verdict |
 *
 * — and **not one of those sections reached a page**. `{{sections.*}}` is bound
 * by 0 of the 13 active `report_templates` rows, and this projection published
 * nothing from `report_content` at all, so a template rendered the scorecard on
 * a fixed page sequence and the report itself was simply absent.
 *
 * ## Why the whole body rather than per-section bindings
 *
 * A section-per-binding shape needs the template to know the section ids, and
 * they are not knowable: they come from whichever guide is configured, they
 * differ per tier, and the guides are edited in the product. A master binding
 * `{{sections.executive_verdict.body}}` is a master that breaks when somebody
 * renames a heading.
 *
 * The body is carried whole instead, by the mechanism this programme already
 * uses for the two other model-authored formats: conditional pages, each
 * holding one bucket of the same source, sized by `packMarkdownPages`. See
 * `markdownPaging.pure.ts` for why the block and this function must be the same
 * arithmetic.
