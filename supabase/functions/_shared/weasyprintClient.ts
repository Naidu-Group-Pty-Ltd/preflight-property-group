 * details below are not arbitrary and are worth having once:
 *
 *  - **Two variable names for the token.** Deployed environments have both
 *    `WEASYPRINT_SERVICE_TOKEN` and the older `WEASYPRINT_API_KEY`; a path that
 *    reads only one works in one project and 401s in another.
 *  - **Quotes are stripped.** A secret pasted into the dashboard with the quotes
 *    around it produces a bearer token that is silently wrong.
 *  - **No fallback.** When WeasyPrint is configured and fails, the caller must
 *    fail too. `render-investment-report-pdf` re-throws for this reason: a
 *    silent downgrade to a lesser renderer ships a client a document that does
 *    not look like the one that was approved.

 * made against a validator rather than from the specification:
 *
 * | rendered as | PDF/UA-1 | PDF/A-2A | PDF/A-2B |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `pdf/a-2b` (what shipped) | fail | fail | **pass** |
 * | `pdf/a-2a` | fail | **pass** | **pass** |
 * | `pdf/ua-1` | **pass** | fail | fail |
 *
 * The interesting row is the middle one. `pdf/a-2a` fails PDF/UA-1 on exactly
 * **one** rule and one check — clause 5, the PDF/UA identification schema in
 * the XMP. Everything structural passes: the tree, the heading levels, the
 * alternative text, the language. So these documents already satisfy both
 * standards' *content* rules and can only carry one standard's *declaration*.
 *
 * The declaration went to accessibility. A screen-reader user and a
 * procurement accessibility requirement both need the file to say so; nothing
 * asks these reports to be archival, and the substance of PDF/A survives the
 * switch anyway — fonts stay embedded 168 of 168, and the output intent the
 * A variant used to add for free is now asked for explicitly.
 *
 * `pdf-1.7` stays for cases that need features a conformance level forbids. It
 * is **this codebase's name, not the engine's** — see `PDF_NO_VARIANT`.
