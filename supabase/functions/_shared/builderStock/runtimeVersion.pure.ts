/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — HOW RELIABLY WE PROCESS, WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND.
 *
 * TWO VERSIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF "NO IMAGE".
 *
 *   `PROVENANCE_VERSION`  what the extractor UNDERSTANDS about a brochure —
 *                         which page is a cover, which picture is the house.
 *                         Raising it reopens answers the DOCUMENT gave.
 *
 *   `RUNTIME_VERSION`     how reliably the worker can OPEN one at all — its
 *                         concurrency, its memory ceiling, what it holds while
 *                         it reads. Raising it reopens failures WE caused and
 *                         touches nothing the document actually answered.
 *
 * WHY THE SPLIT EXISTS. Before it there was one number, and
 * `negativeProvenanceStillStands` compared it without ever asking WHY a branch
 * stopped — so a document we read properly and a document that killed the
 * worker were the same record, gated the same way. Fixing the worker therefore
 * meant one of two bad choices: reopen every property including the seventy-two
 * that were answered correctly, or leave the six we crashed on retired for ever
 * as though their brochures were empty.
 *
 * MEASURED, 7 SEPTEMBER 2026, upload `bd7a0ef5`. Six of seventy-eight
 * properties carried a branch stuck at `attempts: 4` with no verdict — the kill
 * limit, reached without ever recording an answer. Their brochures are
 * unremarkable 8–12 MB documents: run one at a time through this same
 * extractor, all six elect their facade in about a second and 50–68 MB. Five at
 * once peak at 429 MB against a 256 MB ceiling, and the isolate dies. Nothing
 * was ever wrong with the documents; the concurrency was wrong, and the
 * property was told its brochure has no photograph.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is enforced by which writers stamp
 * this number rather than by a rule anybody has to remember:
 *
 *   a worker we destroyed        stamps it — reopened when the runtime improves
 *   a link that is not there     does NOT — a faster worker cannot reach a
 *                                deleted file, and re-chasing 404s for ever is
 *                                not a fix, it is a treadmill
 *   a document that answered     does NOT — it told us something true, and a
 *                                better worker does not change what it said
 *
 * So a record carrying no `runtime_version` is untouched by any bump here,
 * which also makes every record written before this existed correctly inert.
 *
 * RAISE THIS when the worker's capacity to open a document changes — its
 * concurrency, its isolation boundary, its memory discipline. NEVER raise it
 * for a change in what the extractor understands: that is the other number,
 * and using this one for it would silently reopen answers that are still true.

/**
 * 1 — serial claiming, two workers, the whole heavy PDF path isolated.
 *
 * The invocation now claims ONE property, finishes it, releases it and only
 * then claims the next, so a worker never holds a second property's lease and
 * a kill still costs exactly one property — the safety rule the one-per-
 * invocation design was protecting, kept while its throughput ceiling goes.
 * Dispatch is a fixed 2 rather than a count scaled off the backlog, because
 * scaling concurrency with the queue is what turned a large upload into
 * maximum memory pressure. And the isolation boundary now encloses the text
 * read as well as the image election: text reading was measured at 400–1,029 ms
 * against the election's 670–1,215 ms, ran FIRST, and was never behind the
 * slot at all — so half the heavy work was unprotected, which is why a slot
 * that had already proved the principle did not save these six.
 */
/**
 * 2 — a bounded number of documents per invocation.
 *
 * Version 1 fixed the wrong half. Serial claiming and one slot over the whole
 * heavy path stopped five properties of six from being killed, and the sixth
 * — Lot 608 Acclaim Estate — collected four more kills under the new worker
 * against a brochure that reads in 0.84 s and carries its facade render on
 * page one. The document was never the problem, and neither was any single
 * document: what version 1 introduced is that ONE ISOLATE now reads several
 * PDFs and never gives the memory back.
 *
 * Measured, six reads of that brochure in one process: 50 -> 173 -> 236 ->
 * 247 -> 254 -> 287 -> 318 MB. The fifth crosses an Edge Function's ~256 MB
 * ceiling. Every read is under a second, so no clock could see it — the
 * allowance had to be counted in documents, and it is
 * `HEAVY_DOCUMENTS_PER_INVOCATION` in the settler.
 *
 * Raising this is what re-asks the one property version 1 wrongly retired.
 * Measured against production before the bump, exactly one row qualifies:
 * nothing that answered is touched, because only our own failures carry a
 * stamp at all.
