/**
 * THE FIGURES A BUILDER STATES THEMSELVES.
 *
 * A stock list does not always say how many bedrooms a house has, and the
 * extraction is right to leave the field empty rather than invent one. This is
 * the other half of that rule: the builder, who knows their own product, can
 * state it.
 *
 * ## What sent this here
 *
 * `LOT 324 - NEX 20 - V002.pdf` imported with bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces
 * and home size all null, and the Stock List drew four em dashes. The
 * extraction had not failed — it had REFUSED. Measured on the prime, 54 of 57
 * PDF-sourced properties carry bed/bath/car, and all three that do not are the
 * same shape: `Lot 323 "NEX 20, Dual Key layout (Urban Nest Duo)"`, `Lot 324
 * "Dual key layout."`, and one more. A dual-key home is two self-contained
 * dwellings under one roof, so the brochure states two sets of figures, and
 * the model obeyed its first rule rather than collapsing them into one number.
 * An earlier spreadsheet of the same lot said `4 bed / 3 bath` — a single
 * reading of a two-dwelling property, which is the answer that is actually
 * questionable.
 *
 * No parser change could fix that. The document genuinely does not carry one
 * bedroom count, and the only party who can say what should appear on the card
 * is the builder.
 *
 * ## Four rules
 *
 * **AN OVERRIDE LIVES WHERE A RE-IMPORT CANNOT REACH IT.** This is the one
 * that makes the feature real rather than decorative. `writablePatch` in
 * `importStock.ts` names `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `car_spaces`,
 * `building_size_sqm` and `land_size_sqm`, and writes each whenever the file
 * states anything at all — so a figure typed into those columns survives a
 * silent file and is destroyed by the next one that speaks. The builder's
 * deliberate correction would lose to the document it was correcting, exactly
 * the way a repaired image used to lose to a re-upload (#2347). So the stated
 * figures live in `manual_stats`, a column that patch does not name, and the
 * overlay happens on READ.
 *
 * **IT IS A CORRECTION, NOT A REPLACEMENT RECORD.** Each field stands alone
 * and is absent when unstated, so clearing one returns that field to whatever
 * the document says. Nothing here ever writes over `bedrooms` and the rest:
 * the extraction stays exactly as it arrived, which is what makes this
 * reversible and what lets the dialog show a builder the reading they are
 * about to disagree with.
 *
 * **ZERO IS A VALUE.** A studio has no bedroom and a townhouse may have no car
 * space, so `0` is a statement and must round-trip. The importer's own `set()`
 * treats `''` as absent and this must not inherit that: absence is the key
 * being missing, never a falsy value.
 *
 * **HALF A BATHROOM IS REAL AND HALF A BEDROOM IS NOT.** Australian listings
 * count a powder room as 0.5, so bathrooms admit halves; rooms, car spaces and
 * square metres are whole numbers.

 * re-issuing their stock list, which is the record of what they are offering.
