/**
 * Builder stock — the order the two repairs are tried in, and the proof.
 *
 * ONE ENTRY POINT, taking the builder's bytes and returning either a cleaned
 * copy of them or a refusal. Ingestion calls it as an image is stored and the
 * settler calls it for everything stored before it existed, so a picture
 * imported tomorrow and a picture imported last year get the identical
 * treatment from the identical code.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS DETERMINISTIC FIRST, ALWAYS.
 *
 *   clean            the detector found no laid-over graphic → NOTHING IS DONE.
 *                    The builder's file is served exactly as supplied. A repair
 *                    that runs on a picture nobody objected to is a change to a
 *                    photograph for no reason.
 *
 *   small and quiet  `sanitizeOverlay` — arithmetic, no model, no network, the
 *                    same bytes out every time. This is the preferred answer
 *                    and it is tried first even when the generative route is
 *                    available, because a reconstruction nobody has to trust
 *                    beats one somebody does.
 *
 *   large or busy    only then, `inpaintOverlay` — the same mask, the same
 *                    original, a model rebuilding what was behind it, and the
 *                    result composited at the mask alone.
 *
 * AND THE ANSWER IS CHECKED BEFORE IT IS OFFERED. Whatever produced it, the
 * result goes back through the SAME classifier that refused the original. A
 * repair that leaves the graphic legible measures as annotated a second time
 * and is refused here — recorded as work done, never served. That is the only
 * honest way to claim the marketing is gone: not that a repair ran, but that
 * the thing which objected no longer objects.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CAN SUBSTITUTE AN IMAGE. Every path returns either a derivative
 * of these exact bytes or a refusal. There is no branch that reaches another
 * image, another property, a search, a map, a render or a generator, and the
 * refusal deliberately carries no candidate for a caller to fall back to.

   * Lot 13 Hummock Rise demonstrates exactly. Its repaired picture carries NO
   * type at all: both status pills are gone, the strict pass finds zero runs,
   * the faint pass finds zero. The classifier refuses it anyway, for one flat
   * coloured region measuring 7.6% of the frame at (90,116)-(193,179) — the
   * house's black garage door, which was there before the repair and is there
   * after it, and which is refused on the same false positive that hides the
   * completely unmarked Lot 537 Kirramingly.

   * Holding the repair responsible for that is holding it responsible for a
   * judgement about a feature of the house. So the question asked here is the
   * one the repair can actually answer: IS THE MARKETING GONE, AND DID I LEAVE
   * ANYTHING BEHIND?
   *
   *   no type survives anywhere — strict pass or faint, and the faint pass is
   *   ASKED rather than read off a verdict that suppressed it — so a badge that
   *   was only partly removed still fails;
   *
   *   nothing I REBUILT came back as a flat coloured block, which is what
   *   catches a model that painted the mask over in one colour instead of
   *   reconstructing what was behind it;
   *
   *   and no flat block ANYWHERE on the result is filled with a brand colour,
   *   which is what catches a second badge the mask never covered — the case a
   *   supplied `repair_region` makes reachable, because the operator's
   *   rectangle replaces the derived mask entirely.
   *
   * A NEUTRAL flat block that does not overlap the repaired area is not the

   * AND NO BRAND-COLOURED PLATE SURVIVES ANYWHERE — not just under the mask.
   *
   * The claim above ("a second badge that was never masked still fails") was
   * false for a wordless badge: its own flat region set `annotated`, which
   * suppressed the faint pass, and it sits away from the repaired area, which
   * is all the flat-block test looks at. The reachable case is a repair driven
   * by a supplied `repair_region`: the operator's rectangle replaces the
   * derived mask entirely, so a chromatic pill the detector can see is left
   * unmasked, survives the repair, and was served. The colour rule is the one
   * the mask builder and the clearance already trust — `isPromotionalFill`
   * excludes every neutral garage door, roof, wall and patch of sky — so this
   * cannot re-import the Lot 13 false positive; a saturated brand-colour block
   * on a repaired picture is a badge, and the repair is refused rather than
   * served with it on.
