/**
 * Builder stock — three-stage image enrichment.
 *
 * An imported property needs a picture, and there are exactly three places one
 * can come from. They are run in order, they are recorded SEPARATELY, and
 * their provenance is never merged:
 *
 *   1. uploaded_document  the builder's own render or photograph, taken out of
 *                         the file they uploaded. Written by `importStock.ts`
 *                         at import time, not here.
 *   2. google_maps        Street View or satellite imagery of the property's
 *                         actual address, fetched server-side so the API key
 *                         never reaches a browser.
 *   3. internet_search    a broader search for imagery of this development.
 *                         Kept as a URL plus where it was found, marked
 *                         `unverified` for ever, because nothing has confirmed
 *                         it depicts THIS property.
 *
 * THE STAGES MAY FAIL. A property whose address will not geocode, a
 * deployment with no Google key, a search that returns nothing — each records
 * its stage as unavailable and the import stands. Only a stage that produced
 * an image is allowed to change what the marketplace shows.
