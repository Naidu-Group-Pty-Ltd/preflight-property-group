/**
 * Builder stock — WHAT THE SOURCE SAID AN IMAGE IS.
 *
 * There are two separate facts about a Builder Stock image, and until now the
 * pipeline only ever established the first:
 *
 *   1. SOURCE PROVENANCE — "these exact bytes came out of the builder's own
 *      source." That is what `sourceImages.ts` and the hashes in
 *      `source_detail` prove, and they prove it well.
 *   2. IMAGE ROLE — "the builder's source presented THIS image as THIS
 *      property's primary/hero/listing image." Nothing established this at
 *      all, and a marketplace card needs it: a bedroom render, a floorplan, an
 *      estate masterplan and a colour-selection variant are every one of them
 *      genuine builder-supplied imagery, and not one of them is the picture a
 *      client should see first when asked to buy a house.
 *
 * The defect this module exists to end is the confusion of the two. Lot 537
 * Kirramingly Avenue showed a bedroom because the bedroom was a valid,
 * hash-provable, builder-supplied JPEG — which is a true statement about
 * provenance and says nothing whatever about role.
 *
 * SO: ONLY `primary_property` MAY BECOME A CARD'S IMAGE. `unknown` never can,
 * and neither can any of the named non-hero roles. Where the source does not
 * establish a hero, the property gets NO image — an empty frame is honest and
 * a bedroom labelled "Builder supplied" is not.
 *
 * WHAT MAY ESTABLISH THE ROLE, strongest first. Every format lands on one of
 * these, which is what makes this one architecture rather than one rule per
 * file type:
 *
 *   LEVEL 1 — an EXPLICIT property-image field. A spreadsheet column called
 *             "Facade", a Notion file property called "Property Image", a CSV
 *             `image_url`. The source named the field; the field says what the
 *             image is for.
 *   LEVEL 2 — a PROPERTY COVER / PACKAGE HERO. A page, slide or section that
 *             states this property's identity AND its package information and
 *             presents one prominent property image with them.
 *   LEVEL 3 — a STRUCTURAL PROPERTY CONTAINER designating one image: a Notion
 *             row's own page cover, an HTML property card's hero, a table
 *             row's image cell.
 *   LEVEL 4 — nothing of the above. Several pictures exist and the source does
 *             not say which is the property's. The answer is NO PRIMARY.
 *
 * Nothing here looks at pixels, sizes, encodings or file order. Those may
 * REJECT a candidate — a 1×1 pixel is not a photograph — but they may never
 * establish a role, because "largest JPEG" is a statement about a file and the
 * question is about a house.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no IO, no clock. Loaded by the edge functions under Deno
 * and by `src/lib/__tests__` under vitest.
