/**
 * Builder stock — WHICH page of a PDF is the property's cover, and which
 * picture on it is the hero.
 *
 * This is LEVEL 2 of `sourceImageRole.pure.ts` for a paginated document, and it
 * is the half the pipeline never had. `pdfPageImages.pure.ts` finds every
 * picture a page draws and rejects the ones that cannot be photographs;
 * everything after that used to be "the largest one, on the first page that has
 * one", which is a statement about rasters and never about the property.
 *
 * WHAT IT COST. The live Lot 537 Kirramingly Avenue contract has, on the page a
 * person opens first, the lot and street, the estate, the house design, the
 * fixed contract price, the land and build sizes, and one large facade render.
 * On its third page it has "INCLUSIONS" and a bedroom. The old rule reached the
 * third page and took the bedroom, because the bedroom is 2202×1229 and the
 * page draws it across the full bleed. Both pictures are the builder's; only
 * one of them is what this property looks like from the street.
 *
 * THE RULE, AND IT ONLY EVER ANSWERS FROM THE DOCUMENT'S OWN WORDS:
 *
 *   1. A page is a PROPERTY COVER when it states the property's IDENTITY — the
 *      lot, address or reference the row was imported under — together with its
 *      PACKAGE INFORMATION: a price, a configuration, a land or build size, a
 *      contract or package heading. Identity alone is not enough (a floorplan
 *      page repeats the lot) and package facts alone are not enough (an
 *      inclusions page quotes prices).
 *   2. The hero is the ONE candidate picture on that page which the page does
 *      not draw more than once and which no other page of the document also
 *      draws. Repetition is the document telling us a picture is furniture — a
 *      bleed wash, a banner, a letterhead — and furniture is never one
 *      property's listing image.
 *   3. Anything else — no cover page, no surviving candidate, or two of them —
 *      is NO PRIMARY. Not the biggest, not the first, not the most detailed.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a page NUMBER as meaningful. Page one is not privileged;
 * the cover of a package is wherever the package puts it, and a document whose
 * page order we could not establish is refused outright rather than counted.
 *
 * Pure: no imports beyond the role vocabulary and the label reading it shares
 * with `drivePackage.pure.ts`, no IO, no clock.

/**

 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG. The rule used to be "every one of
 * the label's first eight tokens appears on the page", and it is the reason
 * twenty-five live properties show no photograph. The label comes from the
 * stock list — "Lot 51 - Tringa Street, Sandpiper Estate, Tweed Heads South NSW
 * 2486 [Miami 190]" — and the builder's own package cover for that exact
 * property says "Lot 51, Sandpiper Estate, Tweed Heads NSW · Miami 190,
 * Spectral façade". It names the lot, the estate, the suburb, the state and the
 * design. It does not name the STREET, and it writes "Tweed Heads" where the
 * list writes "Tweed Heads South". So `tringa` and `street` are missing, the
 * conjunction fails, and a page that could not identify the property more
 * plainly is refused.
 *
 * Demanding every token is not strictness, it is a demand that two independent
 * documents word an address identically — which nothing makes them do. What
 * actually needs to hold is that the page IDENTIFIES this property and
 * CONTRADICTS nothing about it, and those are the four tests below:
 *
 *   1  THE LOT IS STATED. The label's lot or unit number must appear on the
 *      page as a lot or unit designation. This is the discriminator; without it
 *      there is no identification at all.
 *
 *   2  NO OTHER LOT IS STATED. Every lot the page designates must be this
 *      property's. A page naming Lot 52 is not Lot 51's cover however much of
 *      the rest it shares, and this is what makes relaxing (1)'s neighbours
 *      safe rather than sloppy.
 *
 *   3  THE DESIGN IS STATED, when the label names one. Seven rows share Lot 51
 *      and differ only here, so this is the difference between attributing a
 *      picture and guessing.
 *
 *   4  SOMETHING ELSE CORROBORATES. At least one further label token — the
 *      estate, the suburb, the street where the document does name it — must
 *      appear, so a bare "Lot 51" on an unrelated page cannot qualify.
 *
 *      THE CORROBORATION POOL IS THE ROW'S IDENTITY, NOT THE LABEL'S SUBSET
 *      OF IT. The label is a short display string, and `stockRecordLabel`
 *      includes the estate only when the row has nothing else to show — so a
 *      label can read "Lot 102, Diggers Rest" for a row whose own
 *      `development_name` is "Watsons Reach". Measured live, 2 September
 *      2026: that row's supplied brochure states "Lot 102 Watsons Reach
 *      Estate" beside its package price, which is how house-and-land
 *      marketing writes identity — the estate, not the suburb — and this
 *      test refused it for not saying "Diggers Rest". A builder's own
 *      brochure, fetched and read, became a blank card. So the caller passes
 *      the row's remaining identity names as HINTS, and a hint token counts
 *      as corroboration exactly as a label token does. Hints are spent on
 *      this test and nowhere else: they cannot substitute for the lot,
 *      cannot excuse a page naming another lot, and never touch the
 *      full-conjunction path below — every page accepted without hints is
 *      still accepted, and no test gets weaker than it was.
 *
 * A label with no lot or unit number keeps the OLD conjunction exactly, because
 * for those rows the tokens are all there is and there is no discriminator to
 * lean on. Nothing about this is a similarity score: every test is a statement
 * the document either makes or does not make.

 * already answered upstream and not here: `pageStatesIdentity` requires the

 * page belonging to a different property can never reach this function. Every
 * cover passed in names the same property.

 * So the ambiguity left is not "whose house is this" — it is "which page of
 * this property's own package leads", and refusing that threw away the
 * document entirely.
 *
 * MEASURED, 1 SEPTEMBER 2026. A builder package is a cover page and a floor
 * plan, and both repeat the lot header and the price block, so both qualify.
 * On ten real brochures from the live stock list, five were refused for
 * exactly this and every one of them had its facade render on page 1 and its
 * floor plan on page 2. The rule below recovered all five, changed nothing on
 * the one that already worked, and each recovered image was inspected and is
 * the house.
 *
 * THE RULE: the page that states the MOST of the package is the cover. A
 * cover carries the price, the heading, the land or build size and the
 * bed/bath/car line; a floor plan repeats the header and little else. It is
 * evidence about the page rather than its position, so a document that opens
 * with its floor plan is read correctly too.

 * refuses it — correctly, because it is not evidence about a lot. It IS
 * evidence about a design, and the row states which design it bought.
 *
 * FOUR TESTS, AND EACH REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES:
 *
 *   1  THE DESIGN IDENTIFIES ITSELF, WITHOUT BORROWING FROM A LOT. Every token
 *      of the row's stated design appears on the page as a whole token.
 *      "Elara 18" against an "Elara 21" page fails on `21`, which is what
 *      keeps one design's render off another design's row. The number in a
 *      lot designation is BLANKED before the test, because it is the one
 *      place a page types a number that says nothing about the design:
 *      "Lot 5 · Enzo 10" must not satisfy the `5` of "Enzo 10.5".
 *
 *   2  THE PAGE IS A PACKAGE PAGE. The same `MIN_PACKAGE_FACTS` a property
 *      cover must clear. A design token in a footer, a specification table or
 *      an index is not a design's cover.
 *
 *   3  A LOT DESIGNATION IS RECORDED, NOT REFUSED. This test used to refuse
 *      any page naming a lot, on the argument that such a page is some
 *      property's own package page and taking it for a different lot would be
 *      attribution by coincidence. Measured on 6 September 2026, that argument
 *      does not hold once test 1 has passed: Lot 1004 Five Farms links a
 *      per-design brochure whose page 1 states every token of "Enzo 10.5"
 *      with three package facts — and designates Lot 1002, the specimen lot
 *      the builder first typeset the design for. The page names the design
 *      ITSELF, so the attribution is by declaration, exactly as it is for a
 *      lot-less design page; the specimen lot's pricing is an irrelevant fact
 *      about a different deal, and nothing here reads it. What the designation
 *      still means is a PREFERENCE — see `resolveDesignCover`.
 *
 *   4  EXACTLY ONE PAGE, resolved by the caller through `resolveDesignCover`.
 *      This is what stops a range catalogue: its generic cover states no
 *      design and clears no facts, and if two pages of equal standing both
 *      present the design the document has not said which is its render.

/**

 * of 5334x3334 JPEGs is twelve pages of that before anything has been decided.
 * The edge worker does not survive it: `CPU Time exceeded`, `Memory limit
 * exceeded`, no throw, no `finally`, no response. Measured in production on 2
 * September 2026, the live Luxton list: Lot 516 (10.6 MB, 19 pages) and Lot
 * 6706 (13.2 MB, 23 pages) both sat at `attempts: 2`, one tick from being
 * retired as documents that name no image — while their cover pages hold a
 * 2000x1250 render that reads in under six seconds once it is the only thing
 * decoded.
 *
 * WHICH IS THE POINT: which page can be this property's cover is decided by
 * TEXT, and text costs nothing. So the expensive step is told where to look
 * instead of looking everywhere and being killed before it can be asked.
 *
 * IT IS A SUPERSET, AND THAT IS THE SAFETY PROPERTY. It returns every page
 * `assignPdfMediaRoles` could possibly choose — every qualifying property
 * cover, the structural tie, and every design cover — rather than the one it
 * WILL choose, because narrowing to the winner would make this a second
 * implementation of the choice and the two would drift. Scoping can therefore
 * never remove a page the role assignment would have used; it can only remove
 * pages that could never have won.
 *
 * AN EMPTY ANSWER MEANS "NO OPINION", never "no pages". A document whose text
 * names no cover at all gets the unscoped walk it has always had, so its
 * diagnostics — and the flattened-page path that reads a brochure exported as
 * images — are untouched.
