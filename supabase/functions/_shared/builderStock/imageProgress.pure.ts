/**
 * Builder stock — what a property can HONESTLY say about its picture.
 *
 * THE REPORT, VERBATIM: "if there its running on the backend. There needs to
 * be some kind of indication to let the users know that its running on the
 * backend please wait or some kind of progress bar."
 *
 * PRODUCTION, 4 SEPTEMBER 2026. Three properties on one screen, all three
 * reading "No image yet", and no two of them for the same reason:
 *
 *   Lot 5629 The Grove   a package recovery was RUNNING, started 03:21
 *   Lot 521 Timbarra     four documents read, none presents a cover
 *   Lot 123 Solara       three documents read, one is an image not a package
 *
 * The first is work in flight and the words are a lie by omission — the row
 * looked exactly like a row nothing would ever happen to, so the honest thing
 * for a person to do was assume the product was broken and re-upload the list.
 * Which is what happened, twice, and re-uploading is what destroyed a repaired
 * photograph earlier the same morning.
 *
 * THE RULE. A row says "still looking" when the engine still owes it a stage,
 * and says the picture is not coming only when the engine has FINISHED and
 * come back with nothing. The two are different sentences because they call
 * for different actions: wait, or fix the row's documents.
 *
 * `settled` is the finished stage — the ladder's last rung — so anything else
 * is work outstanding. An unrecognised stage reads as WORKING rather than as
 * finished, because a stage this module has not been taught about is one the
 * engine may still act on, and promising "no picture is coming" about a row
 * the engine is about to photograph is the failure worth avoiding.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock.

   * properties on the 7 September upload that their brochures contained no
   * photograph, when the brochures each hold a facade render that this same
   * extractor elects in about a second — the worker had died reading them and
   * the card reported that as the document's own answer.
