/**
 * Builder stock — is the row arriving the SAME PROPERTY as the one we hold?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `source_anchor` is the source's own id for a row — a Notion
 * block id, a sheet and row — and it is the only identity the live stock list
 * actually carries: not one of its rows has a builder reference, a lot column
 * or a unit column, so both of the importer's match keys are null for every
 * one of them. That made every re-import an INSERT of a brand-new set, which
 * is what emptied the marketplace: eight uploads, twenty-three rows each,
 * `updated` zero every single time, and the imagery left behind on the rows
 * the operator then archived.
 *
 * So the anchor becomes a match key. But an anchor is a POINTER TO A ROW, not
 * a statement about a property: a person can edit that row, or re-use it for
 * the next lot in the estate. Carrying a property's photographs forward purely
 * because a row id matched would be this platform's worst image defect — a
 * builder's photograph of one house shown, badged "Builder supplied", on a
 * different house.
 *
 * Hence: THE ANCHOR SAYS WHICH ROW. THIS MODULE SAYS WHETHER IT IS STILL THE
 * SAME PROPERTY. Imagery is carried forward only when both agree.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A NEW HEURISTIC. Every part is a rule this repository
 * already relies on to attribute a builder's own package to a property —
 * `lotAndDesignFrom` and `streetAddressFrom` are the identity rules the Drive
 * package reader has used since the source-discovery work, and reading the lot
 * out of the row's own label is the same rule for the same reason: the columns
 * are empty and the label is where the source states it.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock.

/**
 * WHAT MAKES TWO ROWS THE SAME PROPERTY.
 *
 * Five parts, and the reason each is here is that changing it changes which
 * house the builder's own package is about:
 *
 *   `development`  the estate. Two lots numbered 43 in different estates are
 *                  different properties.
 *   `lot`          the lot or unit. From the columns when the file fills them
 *                  and from the row's own label when it does not, which is
 *                  every row on the live list ("Lot 60941 - Cloverton
 *                  Estate…").
 *   `street`       the street number and name, by `streetAddressFrom` — which
 *                  already knows that a house-and-land row states its street
 *                  number AS its lot number.
 *   `design`       the bracketed house design. This is the part that
 *                  distinguishes seven rows sharing one lot, and it is exactly
 *                  what `selectPackageDocument` matches a PDF on, so a changed
 *                  design means the package we attributed is the wrong
 *                  document.
 *   `buildingSize` the floor area, which is how this repository already
 *                  disambiguates two candidates for one lot
 *                  (`selectByBuildingSize`). Production needs it: the two
 *                  Cloverton rows are both "Lot 60941 - Cloverton Estate,
 *                  Kalkallo VIC 3064", same estate, same lot, same land, and
 *                  differ only as "[3 Bed · 140 m²]" and "[4 Bed · 154 m²]" —
 *                  a bracket the design regex correctly declines to read as a
 *                  design name. Without the area they are one property, and
 *                  one of them would inherit the other's photograph.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and this is the more important half. Price,
 * land size, availability, expected completion, bedrooms, bathrooms, car
 * spaces and description are NOT identity. They change on almost every
 * re-import — a repriced lot is the same house — and putting any of them here
 * would throw away a correct photograph every time a builder edited a number,
 * which is the failure this whole change exists to end. The test is "would a
 * builder's package for the old row be the wrong document for the new one",
 * and a price cannot make it so.
