/**
 * Builder stock — judging images that were stored before there was a judgement.
 *
 * Ingestion decides display eligibility as it writes each image, so everything
 * imported from now on arrives judged. This is for everything already in the
 * bucket: the same decision, from the same bytes, reached by the same
 * function.
 *
 * THE BYTES ARE RE-READ, NEVER RE-FETCHED AND NEVER REWRITTEN. The stored
 * object is downloaded, measured and left exactly as it was — the object, its
 * hashes and its provenance are untouched. The only write is the verdict,
 * merged into `source_detail` beside the role rather than over it.
 *
 * IT SCANS BY KEYSET, WHICH IS THE PART THAT HAS TO BE RIGHT. An earlier
 * version read the first 5,000 rows and filtered them in memory. Past 5,000
 * images an organisation would have re-read the same already-settled page on
 * every pass and never reached the rest — a sweep that cannot finish is worse
 * than no sweep, because it looks like one. Every pass here starts after the
 * last id it saw, so the scan advances whether or not a row needed work.
 *
 * AND IT SEPARATES A DECISION FROM A FAILURE TO REACH ONE. Two things can stop
 * a row being settled and they are not the same thing:
 *
 *   the classifier could not decide     a container no decoder here reads, a
 *                                       picture past the resource ceiling, an
 *                                       image this classifier cannot call
 *                                       clean with enough confidence
 *                                       → a `pending` verdict, WRITTEN. That is
 *                                         a completed decision for this
 *                                         algorithm version: the card shows
 *                                         nothing, and the next version bump is
 *                                         what revisits it.
 *
 *   the operation failed                no `storage_path`, a download that
 *                                       errored, bytes that could not be read,
 *                                       a verdict write that was rejected, a
 *                                       page query that errored
 *                                       → NOTHING WRITTEN, counted as
 *                                         `unresolved`. The upload's marker must
 *                                         not advance, because the work has not
 *                                         been done.
 *
 * Collapsing the two is how a storage outage would have looked like a finished
 * sweep: every image skipped, `incomplete` false, marker advanced, cron
 * unscheduled, and every card empty for ever with nothing left to retry it.
