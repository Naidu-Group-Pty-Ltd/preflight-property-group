/**
 * Builder stock — which page of an uploaded PDF a property came off.
 *
 * A PDF stock list has no rows and no cells: its properties are read out of
 * prose, and the prose arrives as one string per page. That page number is the
 * only structure the document offers, and it is enough — a property described
 * on page 3 and the photograph drawn on page 3 are about the same house.
 *
 * So this answers one question: which page does each imported property belong
 * to? The answer becomes an ordinary source anchor, the same reserved
 * mechanism a Notion row id and a spreadsheet cell already travel through, and
 * `attributeDocumentMedia` then does the attaching.
 *
 * TWO RULES, AND THEY REFUSE MORE OFTEN THAN THEY ANSWER:
 *
 *   • A property anchors to a page only when EXACTLY ONE page names it. Two
 *     pages naming the same lot is the document declining to say which one is
 *     its record, and the answer to that is no anchor and no picture.
 *   • A document that produced exactly ONE property is that property's
 *     document, and it anchors to the FIRST page presenting a photograph —
 *     the page the brochure leads with, which is the same rule a package PDF
 *     reached through a Notion row already follows. Later pages stay
 *     unanchored: a display-village shot on page 4 is kept against the upload
 *     and shown against nobody.
 *
 * Pure: no IO and no clock.
