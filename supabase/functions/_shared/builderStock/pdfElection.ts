/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — THE ELECTION, AS ONE NAMED UNIT.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. This is the smallest indivisible CPU-heavy unit in
 * the whole builder-stock path: read a document's page texts, judge from them
 * whether the document was readable at all, and elect the one image that is
 * this property's. Both halves parse the same multi-megabyte PDF and neither
 * can be split from the other — the election is handed the texts the read
 * produced.
 *
 * MEASURED 8 SEPTEMBER 2026, from the platform's own per-execution telemetry.
 * A thirteen-property cold start killed the settler thirteen times, and every
 * kill was `reason: CPUTime`: successful executions ended at 1,828 ms of CPU
 * or less, killed ones at 2,031 ms or more, against a 2,000 ms limit. Memory
 * peaked at 108 MB of a 256 MB ceiling — 42% — so the memory ceiling was never
 * the constraint and no scheduling rule could have helped. An indivisible
 * ~2.4 s task does not fit a 2.0 s budget.
 *
 * SO THE WORK MOVES RATHER THAN SHRINKS, and the first thing that needed doing
 * was to NAME it. This module is that name. It is the same TypeScript lifted
 * VERBATIM out of `extractFromDocument` — the same slot, the same thresholds,
 * the same winners — and it is the module BOTH ends run: the Edge path when it
 * runs the election in process, and `builder-stock-pdf-worker` when it runs it
 * where there is CPU for it. Nothing here is a second implementation, and
 * nothing about which image wins is decided anywhere else.
 *
 * WHAT DELIBERATELY DID NOT MOVE. The fetch, the guarded fetcher and its SSRF
 * rules, the `%PDF-` sniff and the "a link to an image is not a package
 * document" identity rule all sit BEFORE this in `extractFromDocument` and are
 * cheap; moving them would have duplicated security logic for no CPU. Every
 * database write — branch attempts, provenance, the image pointer, upload
 * settlement — stays in the Supabase path, so this boundary reads a document
 * and answers, and touches no state at all.
 *
 * Pure of IO except the decoding itself: no database, no network, no clock.

   * had failed: the text read costs 400–1,029 ms against the election's
   * 670–1,215 ms, so very nearly half the heavy work stood outside the guard
   * that exists to stop heavy work piling up. That is why a slot which had
   * already proved the principle did not save them: N documents could be in

   * Recording that as "the document names no image for this property" banks a
   * finished negative produced by a reader that never read the document — and
   * `negativeProvenanceStillStands` would then suppress the source until a
   * version bump. So it is operational, and the property is asked again: the
   * answer changes for free the day this can read a drawn page.
