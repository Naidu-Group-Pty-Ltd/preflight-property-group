/**
 * Builder stock — the FOURTH question about an image.
 *
 * Three were already asked and answered, each by its own module, and none of
 * them is this one:
 *
 *   1  PROVENANCE   did these exact bytes come out of the builder's source?
 *                   (`sourceImages.ts`, and the hashes in `source_detail`)
 *   2  OWNERSHIP    can they be tied to THIS property deterministically?
 *                   (`sourceAssets.pure.ts`, the anchors, the page tree)
 *   3  ROLE         did the source present them as its primary image?
 *                   (`sourceImageRole.pure.ts`)
 *   4  DISPLAY      is that image one to put on a marketplace card?
 *
 * ALL THREE OF THE FIRST CAN ANSWER YES AND THE FOURTH STILL BE NO. Lot 13
 * Hummock Rise and Lot 1663 Ringer Street are exactly that: the builder's own
 * bytes, of that exact property, designated by the source as its listing image
 * — and the picture is the facade under green pills reading "Completed" and
 * "SMSF", a red one reading "$25,000 Rebate", and suburb and state banners.
 * Provenance is perfect and the card is still wrong.
 *
 * SO THE ANSWER IS RECORDED SEPARATELY AND NOTHING ELSE IS TOUCHED. The role
 * stays `primary_property`, because that is what the source said and falsifying
 * it to hide the picture would put a lie in the audit trail. What changes is
 * one extra fact stored beside it, and the display rule reads both.
 *
 * IT FAILS CLOSED, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE THIRD STATE. There are three
 * answers and not two:
 *
 *   eligible     measured, and carries no promotional treatment
 *   ineligible   measured, and does
 *   pending      NOT measured — an encoding no decoder here reads, a file that
 *                broke one, a picture past the resource ceiling
 *
 * `pending` is not `eligible`. An unreadable container, and an image this
 * classifier cannot confidently call clean, must never be a way for a marketing
 * tile to walk past the rule: "we could not tell" and "we looked and it was
 * clean" are different facts and are stored as different values. The card shows
 * nothing either way.
 *
 * ALL THREE ARE TERMINAL FOR THE VERSION THAT PRODUCED THEM. `pending` hides
 * the picture; it is not a request to try again on the next tick. What brings a
 * pending row back is the version below moving, which is how a better decoder
 * or a better classifier reaches images that were stored before it existed.
 *
 * WHAT MAY NOT HAPPEN WHEN AN IMAGE IS REFUSED OR PENDING. Nothing may take
 * its place except another image that independently passes all four questions
 * for the same property. Not an interior, not a floorplan, not a masterplan,
 * not a location map, not another lot's facade, and none of the location or
 * search stages. Where there is no such image, the card shows nothing.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no IO, no clock.
 */

/**
 * Bumped when the decision would change for bytes already assessed.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT `PROVENANCE_VERSION`. Provenance is about where bytes came
 * from and never changes when a display rule does; tying the two would mean
 * every classifier improvement re-fetched every source, and every source
 * change re-ran every classification. They move independently, and a row
 * carries both numbers.
 *
 *   1  first release: flat coloured blocks; prominent overlay typography
 *      regardless of colour or whether anything is drawn behind it; and a
 *      contrast-normalised second pass that reports `overlay_uncertain` rather
 *      than letting faint typography read as a clean picture
 *   2  a run of ink must be wide enough to be a LINE of type before it counts
 *      as one. A single 17x12px mark — foliage against sky, in the top corner
 *      of a recovered Sandpiper facade that carries no overlay at all —
 *      convicted a clean builder photograph and hid it. Every verdict version 1
 *      recorded was reached with that mark counting, so all of them are stale.
 *
 * IT HAS A SECOND HALF IN THE DATABASE. `builder_stock_settlement_target`
 * carries the version production is being brought TO, because the sweep's cron
 * job decides in SQL whether any work is left and SQL cannot see this constant.
 * A bump ships both: this number, and a migration calling
 * `set_builder_stock_eligibility_target` with the same one. A test reads the
 * migrations and fails when they disagree — a bump that ships only this half
 * changes new imports and silently leaves every stored image on the old rules.
