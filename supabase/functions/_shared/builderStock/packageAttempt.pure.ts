/**
 * "We started reading that package and never came back."
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `recoverPackageImage` downloads a multi-megabyte PDF,
 * extracts its rasters and classifies them, and once begun nothing stops it.
 * When the edge worker kills the invocation partway through — `CPU Time
 * exceeded`, `Memory limit exceeded` — there is no throw to catch, no `finally`
 * that runs and no response to inspect. The process simply ends.
 *
 * Every guard the repair already has is blind to that. `MAX_ITEMS_RESTORED_PER_RUN`
 * and `MAX_PACKAGE_RECOVERIES_PER_RUN` are counters that reset with the run.
 * `PACKAGE_RECOVERY_RESERVE_MS` reserves WALL CLOCK, and the binding limit here
 * is CPU and memory. The `try/catch` around the recovery cannot catch a kill.
 * So the next tick reads the same queue, reaches the same property, starts the
 * same download and dies at the same place — for ever.
 *
 * PRODUCTION, 28 AUGUST 2026. Upload `eccc9840` settled twelve properties and
 * then stopped dead on the thirteenth, Lot 104 Finch Road. Every tick from
 * 02:00 onward booted, ran six to nine seconds and was killed, alternating
 * `CPU Time exceeded` and `Memory limit exceeded`, emitting no tick log at all.
 * `source_images_settled_version` stayed NULL, so the upload never settled, so
 * the fallback ladder was never entered, so three properties stayed blank on
 * the live Marketplace. One heavy package held twenty-three properties still.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN BEFORE THE DANGEROUS STEP, which is
 * the same shape as the repair claim the sanitizer already uses: a
 * compare-and-set before the spend, so that being killed is survivable
 * evidence rather than silence. An attempt is recorded, the step runs, and a
 * verdict overwrites the attempt. A kill leaves the attempt standing, and the
 * next tick can SEE it.
 *
 * IT SHARES `source_provenance_result` WITH THE VERDICT, AND THAT IS SAFE BY
 * CONSTRUCTION. `negativeProvenanceStillStands` returns false for any record
 * whose `result` is not `no_deterministic_image`, so an attempt record reads as
 * "no answer yet — ask again". That is the fail-open direction that module
 * chose deliberately, and this leans on it rather than modifying it: no new
 * column, no new table, no change to what a verdict means.
