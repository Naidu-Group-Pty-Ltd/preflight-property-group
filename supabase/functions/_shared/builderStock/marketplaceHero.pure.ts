/**
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE MARKETPLACE HERO STANDARD — how a card frames the property.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACES. Since 30 September 2026 a card showed every picture
 * whole unless its shape was within 3% of 16:9 (`cardPictureFit`). That rule
 * was right about one thing — a blind crop cuts houses — and wrong about the
 * rest: a 2500×2800 render was drawn as a narrow strip of mostly sky, a
 * brochure crop kept the brochure's white page around it, and a house low in
 * a tall frame stayed low. The owner's standard of 1 October 2026 replaces it:
 * every card is 16:9, the property is the obvious subject, and nothing about
 * the builder's file is altered or invented to get there.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS. A pure, deterministic PLANNER: it reads the decoded
 * thumbnail every other judgement here already reads (`sourceImageRaster.ts`,
 * ≤400px on the long side) and writes a PLAN — the photographic region, the
 * building's bounds, and a crop in the served image's own pixels. Nothing is
 * re-encoded: both portals draw the stored plan over the bytes they already
 * serve, so the original is never touched and an already-good picture is
 * never recompressed. The rendering side (`src/lib/marketplaceHero.ts`)
 * applies a plan and computes nothing of its own.
 *
 * THE FOUR RULES THE PLAN OBEYS, in the order they can refuse.
 *
 *   1  CANVAS IS NOT PHOTOGRAPH. Uniform white, black or neutral bands at an
 *      edge (a brochure's page, a letterbox) are trimmed — but only where they
 *      end at a clean photographic edge, so a flat grey sky above a sparse
 *      roofline is never mistaken for a margin.
 *   2  THE BUILDING IS NEVER CUT. Its bounds are found from structure (long
 *      vertical edges — walls, jambs, frames) joined to the edge-dense region
 *      above it (the roof). The crop must contain them in full; a frame that
 *      cannot is not drawn as a crop at all.
 *   3  NO CROP WITHOUT A SUBJECT. A picture whose subject cannot be found is
 *      never cropped beyond the old 3% allowance; it is shown whole.
 *   4  ZOOM IS EARNED. Only a high-confidence subject is enlarged, never past
 *      1.67× and never below 960 source pixels across, so a tiny house is
 *      helped where the file can bear it and left alone where it cannot.
 *
 * And the one that governs everything else: THIS IS PRESENTATION. A plan
 * that cannot be made leaves the card exactly as it was. Nothing here reads
 * or writes eligibility, identity, publication or the primary pointer.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock.
