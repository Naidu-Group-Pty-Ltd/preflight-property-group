/**
 * Builder stock — finding the PROPERTY PHOTOGRAPH inside a builder's brochure.
 *
 * `extract.ts` refuses to take rasters out of a PDF, and it is right to: an
 * image XObject in an estate brochure cannot be tied to a stock row. This
 * module exists for the one case where the document itself IS the row — a
 * package PDF named for one lot and one house design, reached through that
 * row's own link.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY. The first version took "the first JPEG on page one",
 * which is a statement about object order rather than about the document. A
 * brochure page holds a logo, a QR code, icons, a floorplan and a photograph,
 * and object order says nothing about which is which. This reads the page's
 * own CONTENT STREAM instead — the drawing instructions — so every candidate
 * is judged on where it is actually drawn and how big it actually appears:
 *
 *   • the photograph is the largest raster DRAWN on the page, by drawn area,
 *     not by object order, pixel count or position in the file;
 *   • it has to cover a real share of the page, so a logo, an icon, a QR code
 *     and a footer rule are excluded by measurement rather than by name;
 *   • it has to be a photographic encoding (DCT), which is what separates a
 *     render or a photograph from the line art a floorplan or a site plan is
 *     drawn as;
 *   • and it has to be on the page the document LEADS with, which is what
 *     keeps the estate masterplan on page 5 out of it.
 *
 * Anything unparseable yields NOTHING. An empty result means no image is
 * attached at all, which is a correct outcome; a wrong image is not.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no IO, no clock. The one thing it cannot do is inflate a
 * compressed content stream — the caller does that and passes the text back in.

 * `N 0 obj`, so those objects simply do not exist for it, and the live Lot 537
 * contract is exactly that document: its `/Pages` root is object 1098, which
 * lives in an object stream. The catalogue resolved to nothing, the page walk
 * produced nothing, and `pageObjectsInOrder` fell through to its last resort —
 * every `/Type /Page` sorted by OBJECT NUMBER, which is not page order.
 *
 * The consequence was not subtle. That document's cover page was added by a
 * later incremental update, so its page object is numbered 1105 while the rest
 * are 1…229: sorting by number put the property's own cover LAST of twenty,
 * beyond the twelve pages a document is searched, and shifted every other page
 * up by one — so the image drawn on visible page 3 was recorded, and shown to
 * a person, as "page 2".
 *
 * Pure, so it only locates them; the caller inflates and calls
