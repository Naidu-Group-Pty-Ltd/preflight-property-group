 * Builder Stock — taking ONE property's imagery work, and giving it back.

 * The seam between the settler and the per-item claim added by
 * `20261019000000_builder_stock_item_work_claim.sql`. Three calls, and one rule
 * that matters more than all of them:
 *
 *   A MISSING CLAIM FUNCTION IS DEPLOYMENT SKEW, NEVER AN OUTAGE.
 *
 * Edge functions ship automatically when `main` moves; migrations in this
 * project are dispatched by hand, one file at a time. So this module WILL run
 * against a database that does not have the function yet — that is not a
 * hypothetical, it is what happened on 29 August, when a settler requiring
 * `claim_builder_stock_settlement_lease` went live against an unapplied
 * migration and answered 503 on every tick until somebody noticed the whole
 * marketplace had gone blank.
 *
 * So `unavailable` is a first-class answer here, distinct from "nothing to do"
 * and distinct from "the read failed". The caller logs it and uses the old
 * path. Slow is not an outage.
