/**
 * Builder stock — recovering source imagery for stock that is ALREADY imported.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Seventy live properties were imported from a public Notion
 * stock list while the decoder read only the text of each row, so twenty-five
 * builder-supplied renders sitting on those rows' covers were never seen and
 * every card fell through to a Street View badged "Location imagery". The
 * properties are correct, they are selected against, and they are referenced
 * by clients; the only thing wrong with them is the picture.
 *
 * So this re-reads the SAME source and attaches what it should have attached
 * the first time. It is deliberately not an import:
 *
 *   NOTHING IS CREATED AND NOTHING IS EDITED. No stock item is inserted, no
 *   field is written, no availability is touched, no selection is disturbed.
 *   The only writes are `builder_stock_item_images` rows and the
 *   `primary_image_id` those rows earn.
 *
 *   ROWS ARE MATCHED, NOT RE-IMPORTED. The same two conservative keys
 *   `importStock.ts` matches on — the builder's own reference, and
 *   development + lot/unit with both halves present — decide which existing
 *   property a source row is. A row that matches nothing is skipped, because
 *   inventing a property here would be worse than leaving a card as it is.
 *
 *   THE ORGANISATION IS THE BOUNDARY. Every lookup filters on the upload's own
 *   `organisation_id`, so an asset from one builder's source cannot reach
 *   another builder's stock even if two rows happen to read alike.

 * How many properties one run will re-fetch imagery for.
 *
 * THE BOUND THAT ACTUALLY HOLDS. Every other limit in this module is a wall
 * clock, and a wall clock never fired here: fetching, validating, hashing and
 * re-uploading a megabyte of PNG is CPU-bound, and Supabase's edge runtime kills
 * the invocation on its RESOURCE limit — status 546 — long after the work has
 * started and long before 100s have elapsed. Every production settler
 * invocation ended that way. A killed worker returns no response, writes no
 * settlement marker and logs nothing, so the failure was invisible in all three
 * of the places built to make it visible.
 *
 * FOUR, and the number was fitted against production rather than reasoned to.
 * The first attempt used twelve, from the observation that pre-fix ticks always
 * died around the thirteenth image — but that measured the ELIGIBILITY sweep,
 * which only decodes. A provenance restore per property also fetches over the
 * network, validates, hashes, uploads to storage, upserts the row, re-reads the
 * property's stage-1 images and re-points its primary; twelve of those still
 * logged `CPU Time exceeded`. The cap has to sit well under the ceiling, not at
 * it, because the same invocation may also have run an eligibility sweep and
 * must still reach the primary-image enforcement pass that follows it.
 *
 * Draining is not the thing to optimise: the sweep ticks every five minutes and
 * removes itself when the queue empties, so four properties a tick clears a
 * 25-image upload in under half an hour without ever being killed. A run that
 * finishes is worth more than a run that does more, because only a run that
 * finishes writes its marker.
 *
 * IT COUNTS ATTEMPTS, NOT STORES, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE TRADE. Counting only
 * productive work was tried and reverted: the expensive path here is
 * `recoverPackageImage`, which fetches and parses a linked PDF, and it is
 * expensive whether or not it finds anything. Production upload f7e0d4d1 has 70
 * rows of which 13 are already current and the rest yield nothing, so a cap on
 * stores never engaged, all 57 fruitless recoveries ran, and the worker was
 * killed on CPU again.
 *
 * The cost is that such an upload reports `incomplete` for ever and its
 * provenance marker is never written, so the sweep does not unschedule itself.
 * That is the lesser harm: the run now ENDS, in about 17 seconds, and says what
 * it did, instead of being killed every five minutes having said nothing. It
 * does not affect display — eligibility is a separate marker and is settled.
 *
 * The real fix is to remember a row whose package yielded nothing at this
 * version so it is not retried, which is a schema change and belongs with the
 * `packageNotIdentified` accounting rather than here.
