/**
 * Builder stock — WHICH PICTURE A CARD DRAWS, and in what order of preference.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS REPLACES was "the builder's own image, or nothing":
 * `chooseDisplayableImage` filtered to stage-1 source rows and returned null
 * for everything else. That was deliberate and it was right while the only
 * alternatives were an unverified search hit and a satellite tile — neither of
 * which is a photograph of the property, and both of which were being written
 * anyway. The cost was a marketplace of empty frames whenever a builder's
 * source carried no usable render.
 *
 * The rule is now a PRIORITY, and the ranking is the whole of it:
 *
 *   1  the builder's own file, measured clean or cleared
 *   2  the builder's own file with a promotional graphic rebuilt out of it
 *   3  a web-search photograph VERIFIED to be this exact property
 *   4  Street View of this exact address
 *   5  nothing
 *
 * FOUR THINGS THIS MODULE WILL NOT DO, and each is a defect it exists to
 * prevent rather than a preference:
 *
 * A FALLBACK NEVER OUTRANKS A SOURCE. Not a better-looking one, not a newer
 * one, not a higher-confidence one. If the builder supplied a usable picture
 * of the property, that is the picture — which is also what stops the
 * expensive stages from being worth running at all (`images.ts`).
 *
 * FINDING A URL IS NOT VERIFYING A PROPERTY. Every `internet_search` row this
 * system has ever written carries `verification_status: 'unverified'`, and
 * 439 of them exist in production. Those are candidates a model reported; not
 * one of them has been checked against the address. So displayability requires
 * a POSITIVE verification state that no historical row can have — see
 * `WEB_VERIFIED_VERIFICATION` — and the absence of one is never displayable.
 *
 * STREET VIEW IS OF AN ADDRESS, AND ONLY IF IT IS STREET VIEW. The existing
 * Google stage falls back from a Street View still to a satellite tile of the
 * same point. A satellite tile is not a photograph of a house and this ranking
 * does not treat it as one: `product` must say `streetview`.
 *
 * AND NOTHING HERE IS "BUILDER SUPPLIED" EXCEPT THE BUILDER'S OWN FILE. The
 * badge is derived from the same decision that picked the image, so the card
 * cannot say one thing while the ranking did another. See `provenanceOf`.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock, no database.

 * A STAGE THAT DID NOT RUN IS NOT A STAGE THAT ANSWERED, and the distinction
 * is not `unavailable` versus `failed` — it is whether the provider was asked
 * and replied about THIS property.
 *
 *   answered   "No published imagery was found for this property."
 *              "That address could not be located."
 *              "The nearest panorama is 300 m away."

 *              "This property has no street address to look up." (a missing input)
 *              "Location imagery is not configured for this workspace."
 *              "The daily limit has been reached."
 *
 * An answer is knowledge about the property and the ladder moves on from it. A
 * pass that never ran is knowledge about US, and crediting it retires a rung
 * the property was never actually offered. Measured on one import: 58
 * properties had stage 2 retired by a provider being down, and 86 had stage 3
 * retired for want of an address that was in the row the whole time, split
 * across three columns.
 *
 * The ceiling is what keeps the correction from becoming the defect it
 * replaces. Withholding the rung without a bound asks a broken — or an
 * unconfigured — provider for the same stage on every claim, for ever, and
 * pays for it; that is the loop `stageWasAttempted` was widened to close in
 * the first place. Two passes is the same ceiling `MAX_PACKAGE_ATTEMPTS` sets
 * on a builder package, for the same reason: enough to ride out an outage, not
