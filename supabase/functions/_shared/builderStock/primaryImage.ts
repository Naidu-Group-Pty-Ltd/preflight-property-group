/**
 * Builder stock — which image the marketplace card shows.
 *
 * ONE RULE, AND IT IS NOT A RANKING.
 *
 *   A Builder Stock property may display the image the BUILDER SUPPLIED, or no
 *   image at all.
 *
 * Nothing else qualifies. Not a Street View of the street, not a satellite
 * still of the lot, not a search result that might be the development — none
 * of them is a photograph of the property, and a card that shows one is
 * telling a client something untrue about a house they are being asked to buy.
 * The honest alternative to a builder's photograph is an empty frame, so an
 * empty frame is what the card gets.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. The earlier rule was a priority list: source-supplied
 * first, then `google_maps`, then `internet_search`. It meant every property
 * whose builder gave us nothing still showed a picture — badged "Location
 * imagery", which reads as a photograph of the property to everyone who is not
 * reading the badge.
 *
 * The other two stages are still WRITTEN. They are provenance, they are how a
 * support question about a missing image gets answered, and the three-stage
 * schema is unchanged. They are simply never chosen.
 *
 * It lives apart from `images.ts` so it can be exercised directly: `images.ts`
 * reaches for Google and Perplexity and cannot be loaded outside the edge
 * runtime, and a rule nothing can test is a rule that drifts.

 *

 * page-cover slot: the property's own facade with "$25,000 Rebate", "VIC" and
 * "LARA" set over it in coloured pills, or "Completed" and "SMSF". It is exact

 * with a graphic rebuilt out of it by this pipeline. Where the same property
 * holds both (a promotional page cover with its repair beside a clean render
 * recovered from the property's own package), the untouched original is the
 * one the card shows, and no repair should have been the deciding vote.
 * Ordering, never filtering: a property whose only displayable picture is a
 * derivative keeps it, exactly as before.
