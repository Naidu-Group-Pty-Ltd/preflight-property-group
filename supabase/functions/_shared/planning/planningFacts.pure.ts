/**
 * The planning controls a report may state, and what each one rests on.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to end
 *
 * `planning-data-service` has worked since 2026-09-06. It resolves the
 * jurisdiction from the layers themselves, returns the zone, the parcel, the
 * state development instruments and the DA activity, and says which kind of
 * absence each empty cell is. `generate-investment-report` fetches it,
 * assigns it to `enhancedData.planningData` — and then **reads nothing back
 * out of it for the zoning section**.
 *
 * Measured on 262 Pallas Street, Maryborough QLD 4650 (report
 * `aa41bcec-5a5c-434d-9162-96deb50e9bdb`, 16 Sep 2026): the stored row has
 * `spec_zoning` null, `spec_council` null, no zoning key among its 25
 * overrides and no `planning` entry in `data_sources`, while a live call to
 * the deployed service at that report's own coordinate answers
 * `jurisdiction: QLD`, `parcel.status: ok`, `lga: "Fraser Coast Regional"`,
 * `locality: "Maryborough"` under CC BY 4.0. The enrichment worked and the
 * report discarded all of it.
 *
 * What the reader got instead was the prompt's own furniture. The zoning
 * section was a template of bracketed placeholders — `[XX]%` site coverage,
 * `[X]m` setbacks, "Refer to LEP" for minimum lot size, height and floor
 * space ratio, and the sentence "Check minimum lot size requirements
 * (typically 450m²)" — handed to a model with nothing to fill them from. A
 * model asked for a control it has not been given will supply a plausible
 * one: 450 m², 8.5 m, 0.5:1 are the numbers that came back, and a reader
 * cannot tell them from measurements. The template was also written for New
 * South Wales — LEP, DCP, a s10.7 certificate — on a Queensland property,
 * where none of those instruments exists.
 *
 * ## The rules
 *
 * 1. **A control with no source is never a number.** Every cell is a value
 *    with a provenance or a named absence; there is no default, no "typical",
 *    and no bracketed placeholder for a model to fill. This is the rule that
 *    the 450/8.5/0.5 trio broke.
 * 2. **An audited operator override outranks a layer, and says so.** A person
 *    who has read the certificate knows more than a spatial layer, so an
 *    override is never overwritten by an automatic reading — but it is
 *    labelled `operator_stated` rather than presented as a published control.
 * 3. **A layer is indicative; the instrument settles it.** Every answer
 *    carries the jurisdiction's own verification instrument, and the section
 *    says in its own words that this is desktop research rather than a
 *    planning certificate.
 * 4. **The four absences are different sentences.** `not_served` (the
 *    jurisdiction publishes no such dataset), `not_integrated` (no verified
 *    adapter), `licence_restricted` (the data exists and may not be
 *    republished), `none_at_point` (the service answered and nothing covers
 *    this point) and `unavailable` (the read failed) are five different
 *    things, and collapsing them is how "we did not look" comes to read as
 *    "there is nothing there".
 * 5. **Adopted controls and draft amendments never merge.** A draft is
 *    reported under its own heading with its own standing, because acting on
 *    a draft as though it were in force is the expensive mistake here.
 * 6. **Development potential from a zone is conditional, never approval.**
 *    A zone admitting a use is not consent for it; the sentence says so
 *    wherever a potential is stated.
 *
 * Pure: no fetch, no Deno, no clock. The retrieval stamp comes in with the
 * reading.
