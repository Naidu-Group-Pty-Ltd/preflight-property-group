/**
 * The names that decide who this deployment IS — and the one rule about them:
 * the Integrations page can never write them.
 *
 * ## Why this exists now
 *
 * `ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_SECRETS` is GENERATED from the Integrations registry, so
 * every credential field anybody adds to a card becomes writable by that page.
 * That is the right default for a vendor key — the page exists so an operator
 * can bring their own Domain key, their own Resend key, their own GHL token.
 *
 * It is the wrong default for a name that is not a vendor key at all. Measured
 * 10 Sep 2026, the generated allow-list of 246 names already carried ELEVEN of
 * the names below:
 *
 *   SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN          a Supabase personal access token, which
 *                                  reaches EVERY project the account owns
 *   MISSION_CONTROL_URL            where this deployment asks about its own
 *   MISSION_CONTROL_CLONE_API_KEY  billing, seats, activation gate and tokens
 *   MISSION_CONTROL_WEBHOOK_SECRET what it trusts a Mission Control call by
 *   TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY           the twin of this deployment's login widget
 *   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY / _WEBHOOK_SECRET
 *   VERCEL_API_TOKEN / VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN / GITHUB_REPOSITORY
 *
 * None of those is a vendor integration. Each answers a question about the
 * deployment's own identity, its hosting, or its relationship with the platform
 * that provisioned it — and writing one from a settings page either escalates
 * (a management token reaches every project) or re-points (a Mission Control
 * URL decides who this workspace believes its billing authority is).
 *
 * The other eight are refused too, and the fact that today's generated list
 * does not carry them is not the reason they are safe. The list is generated
 * from the registry, so a single credential field on a new card adds a name to
 * it — which is exactly how the eleven above got there. A refusal that only
 * covers what is currently reachable would be a snapshot, not a rule.
 *
 * ## Why it matters more from today than it did yesterday
 *
 * Until now this was reachable only by a superadmin ON THE PRIME, because the
 * write path needs a Supabase management token and no clone has one. Opening
 * the brokered write — so a tenant can finally enter a key on their own
 * Integrations page — makes every name in that list tenant-settable unless
 * something refuses it. So this is not defence in depth. It is the control.
 *
 * Mission Control refuses the same classes independently on its own side
 * (`integrationSecretBroker.pure.ts`), because a broker that trusts its
 * caller's validation is not a broker.
 *
 * ## What is refused, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Refused by exact name or by class: the platform's own runtime wiring, the
 * link to Mission Control, this deployment's hosting and repository
 * credentials, and its login widget's secret half.
 *
 * NOT refused: every ordinary vendor key, including one that supersedes a key
 * the platform forwarded. Superseding is the point — a workspace that brings
 * its own OpenAI key must be able to, and the platform must then stop being
 * charged for it. A rule that blocked that would be protecting the wrong side.
 *
 * Pure: no Deno, so the frontend tests import it too.
