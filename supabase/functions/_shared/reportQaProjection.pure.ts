/**
 * What a Report Q&A template may bind.
 *
 * ## This restates the document, it does not re-read the record
 *
 * `_shared/reports/reportQa/` already builds a `ReportQaDocument` for the
 * flowing `render-report-qa-pdf` route — turns in order, citations, the
 * transcript budget, what was cut and by how much. This projection restates
 * that, exactly as the Comparison, Client Details and Cash Flow Comparison
 * projections restate their normalisers. A second read of
 * `report_qa_messages` would be a second set of answers to "what was said",
 * which is the failure this programme removes rather than adds.
 *
 * ## The answer stays Markdown
 *
 * Every other projection publishes formatted scalars, because every other block
 * escapes its body. This one publishes the answer as **Markdown source**, and
 * `markdown-block` renders it. That is the whole reason the format can be on
 * the families at all: the safety is in the renderer, so the projection does not
 * have to sanitise, and must not try — a projection that pre-rendered HTML would
 * move the escaping decision to whoever calls it.
 *
 * ## Page counts are computed here and honoured by the block
 *
 * A master makes answer page N conditional on `qa.answerPages > N`. That number
 * comes from `packMarkdownPages` — the same function the block uses to decide
 * what page N contains. See `reports/markdownPaging.pure.ts` for why that is one
 * function rather than two.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not publish
 *
 * `structured_report` on the conversation. It is a second, separately-generated
 * document about the same conversation, and binding it beside the turns would
 * put two answers to the same question on one page with nothing to tell a reader
 * which is current.
