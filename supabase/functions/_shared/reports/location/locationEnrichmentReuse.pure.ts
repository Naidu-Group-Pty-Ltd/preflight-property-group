/**
 * RF-7.2B.1B1 — a deterministic location enrichment is bought ONCE per report.
 *
 * ## What it costs today
 *
 * An investment report cannot finish inside one Edge Function invocation — 17
 * sections at ~25s against a ~150s ceiling — so it is resumed, repeatedly, by a
 * two-minute cron. Every one of those invocations re-enters the enrichment
 * block and calls `location-intelligence-service` again, because
 * `existingEnhancedFields.locationIntelligence` is consulted only when DECIDING
 * WHAT TO WRITE:
 *
 *     if (!existingEnhancedFields.locationIntelligence && enhancedData?.locationIntelligence)
 *
 * It guards the write. Nothing guards the fetch.
 *
 * One enrichment is **eight** Google calls, counted from the source and
 * confirmed by the production ledger's exact 6:1 ratio of Places to Distance
 * Matrix over 2026-09-05..08 (612 and 102):
 *
 *   1 × Geocoding          (skipped when a coordinate is supplied)
 *   6 × Places Nearby      transit_station, school, hospital, shopping_mall,
 *                          park, restaurant
 *   1 × Distance Matrix    the CBD commute
 *
 * The health-check report on 2026-09-12 resumed eleven times. Eleven geocodes
 * were purchased for one address. Had the geocode succeeded, the same eleven
 * resumes would have bought **88 Google calls for one report**, of which 80 are
 * a second, third and eleventh purchase of an answer that cannot change: the
 * property does not move between resumes.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A successful, complete enrichment acquired for THIS subject is reused on
 * later resumes instead of being bought again.
 *
 * Three things make that safe, and all three are refusals rather than
 * permissions:
 *
 *   **Identity is stamped, not inferred.** The persisted object carried no
 *   subject, no provider status and no timestamp — so nothing in it could say
 *   which property it described. `assessEnrichmentReuse` refuses anything
 *   without the stamp, which means every row written before this change
 *   re-fetches exactly as it does today. No silent reuse of an object whose
 *   provenance we are guessing at.
 *
 *   **Only success is reusable.** A refused geocode is never persisted at all
 *   (`location-intelligence-service` answers `success: false` with no `data`,
 *   and the caller writes nothing), so failure cannot become a cache by
 *   accident. This module refuses again anyway — no coordinates, no reuse —
 *   because the F1 outage is live and a guard that could freeze a failure into
 *   place would turn a provider problem into a permanent one.
 *
 *   **Incomplete is not complete.** `fetchNearbyPlaces` swallows a failed call
 *   into `{ count: 0, results: [] }`, which is indistinguishable from a genuinely
 *   empty rural area once stored. The acquisition stamp records whether each
 *   stage actually ran, so a Places outage cannot be locked in as "this address
 *   has no schools".
 *
 * This changes no figure in any document. An enrichment reused is byte-identical
 * to the enrichment stored, because it IS the enrichment stored.

 * for — would refuse reuse on every resume and re-buy all eight calls each
 * time, which is the 88-call behaviour this module exists to stop, reached by
 * the guard meant to prevent it.
 *
 * Three acquisitions caps a pathological report at 24 calls rather than 88,
 * and the two extra attempts are worth buying because a transient Places
 * failure is common and a complete set is materially better evidence.
 *
 * Accepting a partial set is NOT calling it complete: `stages.places` still
