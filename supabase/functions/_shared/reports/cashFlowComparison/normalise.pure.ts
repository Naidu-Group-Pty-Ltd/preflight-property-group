/**
 * Turning what the browser sent into a comparison — or refusing to.
 *
 * ## The rule this module is built on
 *
 * **Anything derivable is derived here; nothing derivable is accepted.**
 *
 * `CashFlowAnalysisModal` already computes nine metrics per property
 * (`calculateAdvancedMetrics`, `:1300-1422`) and could simply send them. It does
 * not, and that is deliberate. Two sources for one relationship is how a
 * document says a property returned 41% in a KPI strip and 38% in the table
 * three pages later — the exact defect `cashFlow/normalise.pure.ts` calls out
 * for equity and LVR. So every figure the years imply is recomputed from the
 * years, and the only numbers read off the wire are the ones no arithmetic can
 * reach.
 *
 * That rule has already caught two real defects, neither of which was visible
 * while each number lived on its own screen:
 *
 *  - **Two break-evens.** The modal calls "break-even" the year *cumulative*
 *    cash flow turns positive; `cashFlow`'s `toOutcome` calls it the year
 *    *annual* cash flow turns positive. Both are true and they are rarely the
 *    same year. This module computes both, names them apart, and the document
 *    prints both with a line saying which is which.
 *  - **The peer metrics are not comparable with the primary's.** The modal's
 *    `compBaseData` (`:1438-1444`) carries no `lmiAmount` key at all, so
 *    `totalInitialInvestment` (`:1374`) includes LMI for the property the
 *    adviser opened and excludes it for every property they compared it
 *    against — and that figure is the denominator of ROI, cash-on-cash and the
 *    equity multiple. It also reads `purchasePrice` through a different cascade
 *    (`||`, and without `initialCosts.propertyValue`) from the one the peer's
 *    own projection used. Deriving here from the acquisition block every
 *    property sends makes all N comparable by construction rather than by care.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and why refusing beats coping
 *
 * A comparison is a table with aligned columns, and almost every defensive
 * choice follows from that. A property with four years beside one with ten is a
 * table that lies about what it compared; a set silently truncated from five to
 * four is a document that looks complete. So the failures are loud —
 * `CashFlowComparisonPayloadError`, which the route answers with a 400 naming
 * the property and the field — rather than clamped, defaulted or dropped.
 *
 * ## The analysis is model output arriving through a browser
 *
 * `analysis` is the one part of the payload nothing verified. It is capped in
 * every dimension, a block whose shape does not match the producer's schema is
 * **dropped rather than coerced** — coercion is exactly how the legacy generator
 * ends up handing an object to `pdf.splitTextToSize` — and every string has
 * URL-shaped tokens neutralised. That last one is not hygiene. See
 * `neutraliseUrls`.
