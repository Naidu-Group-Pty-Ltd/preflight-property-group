/**
 * Who a report is issued BY, and the disclaimer that party is entitled to speak.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to end
 *
 * A disclaimer is not a block of boilerplate. It is **a statement by the issuer
 * about the issuer** — what it does, what it is not, and what it will not answer
 * for. So the identity on the document and the disclaimer under it are one
 * decision, and this product had them as two unrelated defaults that disagreed.
 *
 * Rendered on 2026-09-08 through the production renderer with the settings a
 * freshly provisioned clone actually holds — `contact_details.company_name`
 * empty, no white-label brand, the seeded `professional_disclaimer` row — one
 * report of one property came out carrying **three different businesses that do
 * not exist or are not the issuer**:
 *
 * | where | what it printed |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | watermark, tiled over every body page | `NPC` |
 * | PDF `Author` / `dcterms.creator` | `NPC Property` |
 * | back-page masthead | `PROPERTY` / `CONSULTING` |
 *
 * `NPC` and `NPC Property` are another tenant's trading name — the prime's —
 * baked in as `contact.company_name || brandName || "NPC"`. `Property
 * Consulting` is a name no business holds; it is a placeholder that reads as a
 * firm.
 *
 * The fourth copy is the worst, because it is the one a lawyer reads.
 * `useGlobalReportSettings.defaultDisclaimer` was the prime's own wording,
 * verbatim:
 *
 * > *As a Professional Property Consultant & Buyers Agent, we provide
 * > information and advice based on our expertise… Our services include
 * > assisting you in identifying and evaluating potential opportunities,
 * > negotiating purchase terms, and navigating the transaction process… By
 * > engaging our services, you acknowledge…*
 *
 * Under an unbranded clone's masthead every clause of that is false. The
 * platform is not engaged by the reader, holds itself out as nobody's buyer's
 * agent, and negotiates nothing. Printing it is not a cosmetic slip: acting as
 * or holding oneself out as a real estate or buyer's agent is licensed conduct
 * in every Australian state.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * **An identity and its disclaimer travel together.** There are exactly two
 * issuers and never a third:
 *
 *  - **`workspace`** — the deployment has said who it is (a report contact
 *    company name, or a white-label brand name). The document is issued under
 *    that name and the disclaimer is that business's own.
 *  - **`platform`** — the deployment has said nothing. The document is issued
 *    under **Aurixa Systems**, and the disclaimer is the technology provider's.
 *
 * There is no invented trading name, no other tenant's name, and no blank
 * masthead. An unbranded clone is an Aurixa deployment, not a deployment with no
 * identity — the same rule `platformBrand.ts` applies to the favicon and
 * `submissionRecordBrand.ts` applies to the AML submission record.
 *
 * ## Why the platform disclaimer ignores a stored one
 *
 * Fixing the *default* would not have been enough. A clone whose
 * `global_report_settings` were seeded from the prime carries the prime's text
 * in the row, so no default ever fires and the leak survives the fix. The switch
 * therefore sits on the **read**, keyed on the resolved issuer.
 *
 * The rule that makes that safe to state: *a deployment that has not said who it
 * is cannot have a disclaimer of its own.* A disclaimer written by an
 * unidentified party, printed under Aurixa's name, is exactly the confusion this
 * closes — and the escape is one keystroke, because typing a company name moves
 * the whole document to the `workspace` issuer.
 *
 * ## What does NOT change
 *
 * A deployment that has a name keeps every byte it prints today. Stored text
 * wins on the `workspace` issuer, and where there is none the fallback is the
 * literal `render-investment-report-pdf` already carried. The prime has held
 * `company_name: "Naidu Property Consulting Services"` since 2026-02-19, so
 * nothing in this module can reach its documents.

/**
 * What a report issued under the platform's own name says.
 *
 * Five paragraphs, each closing something the consultancy wording left open:
 *
 *  1. **What the document is** — assembled by software from sources the
 *     deployment chose. A reader otherwise has no way to know the analysis was
 *     not authored by an adviser who visited the property.
 *  2. **What Aurixa is not.** Stated as role and conduct ("is not… does not
 *     provide") rather than as a claim about which registrations the company
 *     holds, because the licensing question turns on what is *provided*, and
 *     because this module cannot verify a corporate registration.
 *  3. **The data.** Third-party and public sources, unverified, possibly stale;
 *     a projection rests on assumptions and is not a forecast. This report
 *     prints ten-year cash flow tables, so the distinction is load-bearing.
 *  4. **Responsibility — and its limit.** Aurixa answers for nothing arising
 *     from reliance on the document, *and that does not extinguish the reader's
 *     rights against whoever gave it to them.* A platform disclaimer that
 *     appeared to wipe out the operator's own obligations would be a worse
 *     document than the one it replaces.
 *  5. **What to do instead** — independent advice and the reader's own enquiries.
 *
 * The word "we" appears nowhere: the issuer is a party the reader has no
 * relationship with, and "we" is what made the consultancy wording read as an
 * engagement.
