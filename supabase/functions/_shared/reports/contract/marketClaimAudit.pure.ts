/**
 * RF-7.2B.1 §7 — does the prose describe the fact it was handed?
 *
 * The gate decides what a model may SEE. This decides whether what it then
 * WROTE still describes that thing. They are different questions, and the
 * second one is the one RF-7.2A named as structural: reconciling prose against
 * the injected facts proves faithfulness, not truth — so this checks the
 * remaining half, which is whether a faithful number has been given an
 * unfaithful label.
 *
 * Three faults, each measured in production and each named by the mandate:
 *
 *  - **Grain.** `abs_census_poa` is postal-area data. A postcode covers
 *    several suburbs and rarely matches one, so "Cobblebank's population is
 *    18,234" is a different claim from the one the figure supports.
 *  - **Period.** The 2021 Census is five years old. Printing its figure beside
 *    "current", "today" or "latest" restates a historical measurement as a
 *    present-tense fact.
 *  - **Source.** `FIRMMCRT` is a monthly AVERAGE of the cash rate target.
 *    Calling it "the current cash rate" names a number the Board never set.
 *
 * ## What a fault does (RF-7.2B.1 §4)
 *
 * Generation still completes — a report is not failed mid-run over a word, and
 * the model is not asked to re-write itself. What changes is CLIENT READINESS.
 *
 * Each fault becomes a `validation_flags` entry, which is the report QA
 * mechanism that already exists: `QualityAssurance.tsx` splits reports into
 * `cleanReports` and `reportsWithValidationIssues` purely on
 * `validation_flags.length > 0`, so a report carrying one of these is no longer
 * clean and cannot be presented as such until it is corrected.
 *
 * They are raised at `high` — the existing severity vocabulary is
 * `critical | high | medium`, and the page counts and surfaces those bands.
 * That is deliberately a step above the `warning` the prose-vs-record
 * reconciliation uses beside it: a yield that disagrees by a rounding step is a
 * possible discrepancy, whereas these three are VALIDATED semantic errors about
 * what a figure is — a postal area called a suburb, a five-year-old census
 * figure called current, a monthly average called the rate in force. A warning
 * that no band counts is exactly the "silently client-ready" state this closes.
 *
 * What this does NOT do: gate delivery. Nothing in the product consults
 * `validation_flags` before a report is shared or downloaded — `status` is set
 * to `completed` unconditionally — and adding such a gate would be a new
 * workflow rather than a use of the existing one.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It matches a fact's own value in the prose and reads
 * the words immediately around it, rather than trying to parse claims in
 * general — a broad claim parser that is 80% right generates more noise than
 * signal, and a reviewer who learns to ignore these flags is worse off than
 * one who never had them.
 *
 * Pure: no Deno, no network, no clock.
