/**
 * RF-7.1 — the Report Fact Contract for the Investment Property Report.
 *
 * One typed, versioned, deterministic answer to "what does this report
 * actually know, how does it know it, and how much of it is absent?"
 *
 * ## This is an ADAPTER. It owns nothing.
 *
 * Every figure here is produced by a module that already owns it and keeps
 * owning it:
 *
 * | fact family        | canonical owner (unchanged)                        |
 * | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
 * | observed facts     | `facts/historicalFactAuthority.pure.ts`             |
 * | derived ratios     | `metrics/propertyMetrics.pure.ts`                   |
 * | finance block      | `investment/financialEngine.pure.ts`                |
 * | property specs     | `investment/propertyRecord.pure.ts`                 |
 * | duty & acquisition | `stampDuty/engine.pure.ts` (read, never re-run)     |
 * | geography identity | `report_geography` (the table, via its resolver)    |
 * | scoring state      | the `policy` stamp the scoring run wrote            |
 *
 * Nothing in this file re-implements any of them, and nothing in this file is
 * imported by any of them. The dependency arrow points one way, which is what
 * makes RF-7.1 removable: delete this directory and the platform is exactly
 * what it was.
 *
 * ## Why it exists at all
 *
 * The same fact is read differently by the viewer, the PDF projection, the
 * template adapter, the comparison and the Q&A surface — each with its own
 * `??` chain — so "what is this report's purchase price" has had as many
 * answers as it has readers. This is the one place that answers it, with the
 * path it was read from and the reason it is absent when it is.
 *
 * `historicalFactAuthority` already settled the precedence for eight fields
 * and has **no production consumer** — RF71_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md §4.1. This
 * contract adapts it rather than becoming a third implementation of the same
 * ordering, which is the entire point of the strangler.
 *
 * ## Four rules it is built on
 *
 * **Absent is absent.** Never `0`, never `''`, never `false`, never a default
 * house, never a placeholder coordinate. A `Fact` whose `status` is `absent`
 * carries a `reason` sentence and a `null` value, and there is no third state
 * where a reader has to guess.
 *
 * **A trusted metric is not a scored assessment.** `grossYield` is arithmetic
 * on two figures the operator stated; a dimension score is a judgement an
 * engine made. They live in different sections and neither can be read as the
 * other.
 *
 * **Geography identity is not Location scoring.** `report_geography` is a
 * point-in-polygon answer against ABS ASGS boundaries and never consults the
 * free-text address; the Location dimension's walk score, commute and school
 * count are a separate, untrusted thing (audit §69). Putting them in one
 * section is how a suburb name came to be treated as evidence of amenity.
 *
 * **Finance is not property quality.** Leverage and holding cash flow describe
 * the BUYER. They are reported in `finance` and are admitted to no assessment,
 * exactly as the scoring policy requires.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * No database read, no network call, no model call, no clock, no randomness,
 * no write of any kind. It receives already-loaded rows and returns a value.
 * `observedAt` is a parameter, never `new Date()`, so the same input produces
 * a byte-identical contract forever.
 *
 * ## Not a consumer of this, yet
 *
 * RF-7.1 ships this beside the working Reporting Engine and switches nothing.
 * The viewer, the PDF routes, the templates and the generation path all read
 * exactly what they read before. Adoption is a later, controlled stage.
