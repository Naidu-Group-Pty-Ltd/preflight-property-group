/**
 * Governed narrative authority — a withheld fact may not be re-sourced.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes, measured in production
 *
 * RF-7.2B.1's Client-Safe Gate withholds demographics, SEIFA and employment
 * when no trusted geography is available. Two reports generated on 2026-09-11
 * through the real pipeline (`09f8569e…` Cowra, `3fbbcfe6…` Muswellbrook) had
 * `market.demographics` recorded `absent` in `market_fact_snapshot` — and both
 * documents then stated demographic figures anyway:
 *
 *   "According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2021 Census,
 *    Muswellbrook township recorded 12,272 residents, with a median age of 35"
 *
 * `abs_census_poa` for POA 2333 holds **13,795** and median age **36**. The
 * figures are not the platform's; they came from the section generator, which
 * is Perplexity `sonar-pro` — a SEARCH-GROUNDED model. Withholding the
 * authoritative number did not remove the claim, it removed the source: the
 * prompt still asked for a demographics section, so the model searched, and
 * wrote what it found under an ABS citation at a geography nobody asked for
 * (township, SA2, LGA, ERP — never the subject postal area).
 *
 * Three things were true at once and each was necessary:
 *
 *  1. **The withholding never reached the prompt.** `safeGeneration.removed`
 *     was `console.log`ged and nothing else, so the model was never told a
 *     category was unavailable, only handed a context without it.
 *  2. **The post-generation audit could not see it.** `auditMarketClaims` is
 *     VALUE-anchored — it finds a number it already holds and checks the prose
 *     around it (`if (fact.status !== 'present') continue`). A withheld fact
 *     has no value to anchor on, so nothing was checked.
 *  3. **Each half assumed the other covered it.** `marketClaimAudit`'s header
 *     said a mention of a withheld figure was "a different defect that the
 *     fact reconciliation already looks for". It does not:
 *     `factReconciliation.pure.ts` contains no occurrence of `withheld`,
 *     `absent`, `demographic` or `population`. Neither module covered it.
 *
 * ## The invariant
 *
 * **A governed market fact may be narrated quantitatively only when an
 * admissible corresponding fact exists in `market_fact_snapshot`.**
 *
 * This module is both halves of that, deliberately in ONE file: the directive
 * the prompt carries and the audit that checks the result read the same
 * category table. Two copies of "which categories are governed" is exactly how
 * the two modules above drifted apart.
 *
 * ## Why detection is sentence-scoped
 *
 * A governed TERM alone is not a claim — "tenants are typically local workers,
 * families and retirees rather than transient short-stay populations" says
 * nothing quantitative and must pass. A NUMBER alone is not a claim either —
 * "the near-1,000 m² land size" is the property's own fact. The claim is the
 * two together, in one sentence. Scoping to the sentence rather than a
 * character window is what stops a land size three clauses away from being
 * read as a population count.
 *
 * Bare four-digit years are excluded from what counts as quantitative, because
 * "the 2021 Census" beside the word "population" is an attribution, not a
 * figure. A genuine population of exactly 2,021 people written without its
 * separator would be missed; that is the conservative side of the trade and it
 * is preferred to blocking a report for citing a census year.
 *
 * Pure: no Deno, no DOM, no network, no clock.

 * shares are capped at `SNAPSHOT_INDUSTRY_ROWS`, so an unlisted industry has
 * no fact either.
 *
 * The categories are therefore NOT atomic, and a category-level reading would
 * let one present figure authorise every absent one beside it: exactly the
 * substitution this module exists to refuse, performed with the module's own
 * blessing. Standing is resolved per topic, against the facts that topic owns.
 *
 * A topic with `owns: null` has no fact of its own in the snapshot vocabulary
 * — average household size is narrated but never snapshotted individually — so
