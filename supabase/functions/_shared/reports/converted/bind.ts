/**
 * Proposing a binding by asking, with the scorer as the fallback.
 *
 * `binding.pure.ts › proposeBinding` matches on shared words. That is exactly
 * right for one of our own reports read back — after the chapter list was
 * fixed, a Borrowing Capacity Snapshot binds its three chapters at 88, 96 and
 * 91 without any model at all — and it is not enough for a stranger's template,
 * where "Serviceability Assessment" has to reach "How the capacity is built".
 * Those share no word. The scorer scores zero and the chapter goes unfilled
 * while the section goes to the appendix, which is a safe answer and a poor one.
 *
 * So: ask, then fall back. The model's answer is not trusted — it goes through
 * `readBindingPlan`, the same reader that validates a plan a person edited in
 * the browser, which re-checks every index against the structure and enforces
 * one-to-one. On any failure at all the scorer's answer is used and the screen
 * says which one it got.
 *
 * The prompt and the schema are in the pure module beside the reader; this file
 * is the fetch.
