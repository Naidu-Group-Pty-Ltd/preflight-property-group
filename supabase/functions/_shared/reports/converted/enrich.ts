/**
 * Enrichment, the part that talks to Anthropic.
 *
 * Everything decidable is next door in `enrich.pure.ts` — the vocabulary, the
 * schema, the prompts, the reader, the quota — and `faithfulness.pure.ts` holds
 * the figure check. This file owns the fetch, the concurrency and the one
 * retry, and nothing else. That split is what lets the guards be tested by
 * handing them bad blocks rather than by mocking an API.
 *
 * ## It cannot fail the render
 *
 * Every failure path here — no key, a timeout, a refusal, a guard rejecting
 * twice, zero blocks — resolves to *that chapter having no entry* in the
 * returned map, and `render.pure.ts` renders a chapter with no entry exactly as
 * the converter always did. So the worst outcome of this whole module going
 * wrong is the output the converter produced before it existed. Nothing here
 * throws, and `enrichChapters` has no rejection path.
 *
 * ## Why chapters are enriched separately
 *
 * One call per chapter, not one per document. A chapter is the unit a person
 * confirms on the review screen, it is the unit the page budget is costed in,
 * and — the reason that actually decides it — a single document-wide call
 * fails as a single document-wide unit. Six chapters means six independent
 * chances to succeed, and a run where five chapters designed and one fell back
 * to prose is a good outcome rather than a wasted eleven seconds.
