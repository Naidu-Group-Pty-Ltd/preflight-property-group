/**
 * The shape of a render request and what comes back.
 *
 * Everything here is pure, which is the point: the edge function around it does
 * auth, four reads, a render, an upload and two writes, and none of that is
 * testable in a unit test. Request validation, the filename a client sees and
 * the path a file lands at are testable, and they are the parts that have a
 * contract to keep.
 *
 * The filename is that contract. `ClientReportsTab.tsx` publishes the Snapshot
 * to the client portal and four call sites download it, all under
 * `Borrowing_Capacity_Snapshot_<SafeName>_<date>.pdf` today
 * (`BORROWING_CAPACITY.md` §5). A migration that quietly renames the file
 * renames it in the client's downloads folder too.
