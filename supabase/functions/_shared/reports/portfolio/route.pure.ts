 * reach.
 *
 * ## The caller sends an id and nothing else
 *
 * Unlike the Cash Flow route, which has to accept a projection because the
 * browser holds unsaved overrides, everything this document says is already
 * persisted. So the request is one identifier, and the route reads the rest.
 * A caller cannot choose the client's name, the figures, or which review is
 * folded in.
 *
 * ## The filename is a contract
 *
 * `PortfolioAnalysisPDFGenerator` has been producing
 * `Portfolio_Analysis_<Client>.pdf` since the format existed, and clients have
 * those files in their downloads folders. The pattern below is that one with the
 * date appended, not a new one.
