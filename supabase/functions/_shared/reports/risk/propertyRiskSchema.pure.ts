/**
 * ME-5.1 items 1–3 — property type SELECTS the risk questions; it never answers
 * them.
 *
 * ## The contradiction this corrects
 *
 * ME-5 §58.6 concluded, with evidence, that **asset type is a classifier, not a
 * score**: the numbers are unevidenced, 70.4% of resolvable reports receive the
 * identical 82, two real stored types resolve to nothing, and vacant land is a
 * different asset class rather than a worse house.
 *
 * It then recommended Model B, which weights `assetType` at **0.67** — more
 * than triple the 0.20 the live model gives it. The recommendation contradicted
 * the finding, and the invariance test did not catch it because invariance is
 * the wrong instrument: it asserts that the SAME property scores the same
 * across reports, and says nothing about whether a house and a unit are
 * compared fairly. A model can be perfectly invariant and still hand every
 * house 82 and every unit 55 for no evidenced reason.
 *
 * ## What replaces it
 *
 *   propertyType → selects the applicable risk QUESTIONS
 *                → genuine property-specific evidence answers them
 *                → Risk exists only where enough of it does
 *
 * The asset class contributes **zero points**. It decides which questions are
 * worth asking of a dwelling of that kind, which is a classification job and
 * the only thing the stored type is competent to do.
 *
 * ## What this deployment can actually answer, measured
 *
 * Every question below is declared with the evidence that would answer it and
 * whether the platform holds it. Measured on 8 September 2026:
 *
 * | candidate source | rows | grain | property-level? |
 * | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
 * | `crime_reference` / `crime_month_counts` | 54,001 | postcode, LGA, SA2 — NSW, QLD, SA, NT only | no |
 * | `abs_seifa_poa` + `abs_census_poa` | 5,270 | postcode | no |
 * | `climate_data_cache` | 1,237 | area | no |
 * | `planning_data_cache` | **2** | — | effectively empty |
 * | flood / bushfire hazard | **none** | — | not held |
 * | strata / body corporate | **none** | — | not held |
 * | condition / inspection / defects | **none** | — | not held |
 *
 * So the honest answer is that **Aurixa holds no property-level risk evidence
 * at all.** What it holds is area context that other dimensions already own —
 * crime and SEIFA are Location's, and scoring them here would double-count the
 * same signal under a second name.
 *
 * That is why every question resolves `unavailable` today and Risk is null.
 * The brief anticipated this: *"Do not manufacture Risk merely because its
 * nominal composite weight is 5%."* A schema that names what is missing is
 * worth more than a score that invents it, because it is also the acquisition
 * list.
