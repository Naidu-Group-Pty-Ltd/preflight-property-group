/**
 * Packing rendered Markdown into fixed-height page buckets.
 *
 * This lives on the shared side, and is imported by both the `markdown-block`
 * renderer in `src/lib/reportTemplate/blocks/` and the narrative projections,
 * for a reason that is not tidiness. A master makes page N conditional on
 * `narrative.pages > N` (or `qa.answerPages > N`), and the block decides what
 * page N contains. If the two disagreed by a single line the document would
 * either print a blank page or silently drop its tail — and the tail is the
 * end of something a client is reading. They have to be the same arithmetic,
 * so they are the same functions, and a format that opts into the calibrated
 * profile below must do so on BOTH sides through `resolveNarrativeProfile`.
 *
 * ## The 2026-09 calibration
 *
 * `scripts/reports/markdownCalibration.mts` rendered probes through the real
 * seeded Investment Compass master (WeasyPrint 69, the pinned engine) twice:
 * once with the pager in charge, once with the bucket cap lifted so the page
 * geometry decided. The pager was sending pages at **40–47% of what they
 * hold**: a continuation page really fits ~54.5 rendered line-units and the
 * first narrative page ~42.5 (part-header furniture), while the legacy charge
 * model (65 chars/line, integer rounding) summed the same content to 34 units.
 * Real prose wraps at ~98 characters on this measure, not 65. That under-fill
 * is where every "large sectional gap" in a narrative page came from — the
 * page broke long before it was full.
 *
 * The calibrated profile pairs the measured charge model in `markdown.pure.ts`
 * (`charging: 'measured'`) with budgets set 8% under the measured capacity,
 * because template families set their own body size and a slightly larger face
 * must not push the last line past the box. `DEFAULT_LINES_PER_PAGE` (34) is
 * ALSO the value baked into every deployed master's block props, so it doubles
 * as the legacy sentinel: a schema still carrying 34 is read as "use the
 * calibrated profile" by the formats that opt in, while any other explicit
 * value is honoured verbatim — a hand-tuned master keeps its tuning.

 * 50 budget and still overflowed the physical box: the estimator's error on
 * a list-and-margin-heavy page exceeded the 8% held back, the tail printed
 * over the running foot, and the sources bullet lost its description with
 * nothing saying so. The budget therefore sits ~16% under the measured
