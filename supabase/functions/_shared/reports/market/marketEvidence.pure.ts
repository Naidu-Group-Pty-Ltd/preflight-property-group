/**
 * `MarketEvidence` — the one structure the scoring engine is allowed to read.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The scorers currently read a provider's own vocabulary. Every one of them
 * does `demographics.marketData || financials.marketData || {}` and then reaches
 * for `medianPrice`, `priceGrowth1Year`, `vacancyRate` — names that no writer in
 * this repository has ever written (audit §47). Domain's own service returns
 * `medianSoldPrice`; the ABS returns a quarterly index by GCCSA; a state
 * valuer-general returns individual sales. Three shapes, and the engine
 * understood a fourth that did not exist.
 *
 * So the engine stops knowing about providers. An adapter turns a provider's
 * answer into `MarketEvidence`; the engine consumes `MarketEvidence` and nothing
 * else. Adding a provider is then an adapter, never a change to a scorer.
 *
 * ## The rule that shapes it: provenance is per MEASURE, not per envelope
 *
 * The obvious design puts one `source`/`level`/`asOf` on the whole record. It
 * cannot work here, because the evidence hierarchy fills different fields from
 * different levels in the same request: a median from the suburb, a vacancy
 * rate from the postcode, a benchmark from the GCCSA. An envelope-level
 * `level: 'suburb'` would then be a false statement about two thirds of the
 * fields, and the report would print it.
 *
 * Every measure is therefore an {@link EvidencePoint} carrying its own level,
 * area, dwelling-type match, provider, period, sample size and method. That is
 * what lets a document say *"Bowral houses, 62 sales, year to 2026-Q2, Domain"*
 * beside *"benchmark: Rest of NSW, ABS"* without either claim borrowing the
 * other's authority.
 *
 * ## Absent is absent
 *
 * Every field is optional and `null`/absent means **not measured**. There is no
 * zero default, no 50, no placeholder — the rule the 0.00% yield and the
 * placeholder `50` growth score both cost this product once each. A measured
 * zero is a real value and is representable: `{ value: 0, … }` is a
 * transaction count of zero, which is a fact, while an absent point is the
 * absence of one.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT contain
 *
 * No score, no grade, no weight, no confidence *verdict*. This is evidence;
 * scoring reads it. Mixing the two is how a provider's marketing number
 * ("Domain confidence: high") becomes a grade the business has to defend.
 * `sampleSize`, `periodsAvailable`, `level` and `asOf` are the raw inputs a
 * confidence calculation needs, and they are facts rather than judgements.
 *
 * Pure: no Deno, no imports, so the frontend tests and the Edge Functions
 * share one definition.
 */

/**
 * How precisely a measure is located, finest first.
 *
 * Ordering is meaningful — {@link isFinerThan} and the evidence hierarchy both
