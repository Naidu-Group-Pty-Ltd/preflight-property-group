/**
 * The forward-only scoring policy — what may reach a client's overall grade.
 *
 * ## What this closes
 *
 * Two measured findings sit behind this module, both on the live corpus of
 * 1,006 scored reports:
 *
 * **The grade was never evidenced** (`SCORING_ACCURACY_ZERO_COST_CLOSEOUT.md`).
 * Growth scored exactly 50 on 1,005 of 1,006 reports and Demand likewise, with
 * `hasData: false` on all 1,006 — so 55% of every grade issued was a constant.
 *
 * **The inputs that did report data cannot be trusted**
 * (`SCORING_INPUT_INTEGRITY_CLOSEOUT.md`). Location's three inputs are a
 * per-state template, a fabricated commute (mean 10,125 minutes, non-NSW
 * reports routed to Sydney) and a school count at its ceiling on 851 of 1,114.
 * Trusted Location coverage is **0 of 1,006**.
 *
 * The scoring service already knew how to withhold a headline —
 * `dataInsufficient` suppresses `totalScore` below three measured dimensions —
 * and the path had simply never fired, because a dimension computed from
 * defaults still reported `hasData: true`. **This module makes `hasData`
 * honest.** Nothing else in the scorer changes.
 *
 * ## Two independent rules, and why both are needed
 *
 * **Trust** asks whether the number is believable. **Ownership** asks whether
 * it belongs to the dimension reading it. They are different questions and an
 * input can fail either:
 *
 *   * a walk score is the right input for Location and is not believable;
 *   * a buyer's LVR is perfectly believable and is not a fact about the
 *     property at all.
 *
 * Ownership mirrors `dimensionOwnership.pure.ts` — the matrix Risk Model D is
 * built on — in this service's own input vocabulary. Buyer leverage and buyer
 * cash flow are owned by `finance` and forbidden to every dimension, which is
 * why V1's Risk (40% leverage, 30% serviceability) has no admissible input
 * left and stops scoring.
 *
 * ## Forward-only by construction
 *
 * This decides what a NEW scoring run may count. It reads no stored row and
 * writes none, so no historical report is touched, nothing is migrated and
 * nothing is recomputed. A stored score stays exactly as it was issued.
 *
 * ## Trusted evidence leads to V2, never back to V1
 *
 * `verifiedInputs` lets a caller mark an input as verified, and it is worth
 * being exact about what that does and does not mean, because an earlier draft
 * of this module overstated it.
 *
 * It affects **admissibility only** — whether a dimension may count an input.
 * It has no bearing on {@link ScoringAuthority}, so no amount of verification
 * makes V1 authoritative for a new report. Evidence and authority are answered
 * separately and deliberately: gating inputs alone would have left a trapdoor
 * where verifying three inputs later quietly reinstates the legacy methodology
 * as the production grade engine, which is a decision nobody would have taken.
 *
 * The intended path for genuinely trusted evidence is:
 *
 *     trusted evidence → Scoring V2 engine → score output contract
 *                      → report fact contract → reporting
 *
 * after an explicit V2 production activation that WIRES THAT ENGINE. It is
 * **not**:
 *
 *     trusted evidence → legacy V1 reactivation
 *
 * and it is not a label change inside this service either — see
 * {@link LegacyScoringAuthority}.
 *
 * **The field is not wired to the live request path.** Measured 2026-09-11:
 * `transformInputData` builds its result field by field from the nested
 * request shape and does not carry `verifiedInputs` through, so the only way
 * to set it is the flat-passthrough branch — and no caller in this repository
 * sets it by either route. It exists so the policy can be exercised directly
 * in tests and internal diagnostics. Wiring it to a caller would be a change
 * with a decision behind it, not a detail.

 * the number while publishing the sentence would close the front door and leave
 * the back one open.
 *
 * Two kinds of claim, two different rules:
 *
 * **From a dimension SCORE** — "solid capital growth track record", read off a
 * growth score. Permitted only where that dimension was genuinely measured AND
 * an authorised methodology produced it. Under `unavailable` there is none, so
 * none of these may be made.
 *
 * **From an INPUT's value** — "higher than ideal vacancy rate", read off the
 * vacancy figure itself. Permitted only where the policy admitted that input,
 * which is what stops a per-state walk-score template becoming "high
 * walkability" in prose.
 *
 * What survives either way is a **fact**: a gross yield of 4.69%, a rent of
 * $650, a purchase price. Those are calculations over verified inputs and are
 * described freely — an unauthorised methodology simply may not convert them
 * into a verdict about the property.
 *
 * **Buyer facts are a separate case and do not appear here at all.** Leverage
 * and holding cash flow are owned by `finance` and admitted to no dimension,
 * so `fromInput` refuses them for every property claim. That is deliberate
 * rather than incidental: a borrowing position is not a property weakness. The
 * figures stay fully available in Finance Suitability and the financial
 * analysis, which is where a reader can act on them.
