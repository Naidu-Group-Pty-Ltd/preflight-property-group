/**
 * The rental-return dimension, measured once.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to end
 *
 * `calculateYieldScore` bands the gross yield and then subtracts 20 more points
 * when weekly cash flow is below −$100. Both halves are measuring the same
 * economic fact, and the band's own wording says so — the 6%+ band reads
 * *"Strong positive cash flow"* and the sub-2% band reads *"Negative cash flow
 * likely"*. The penalty then charges for it a second time.
 *
 * Measured across the 993 stored scores on 2026-09-08, the stored subscore and
 * the stored `details` string **contradict each other on every row**, and the
 * gap is exactly the penalty:
 *
 * | stored score | its own `details` | band that text comes from |
 * | ---: | --- | ---: |
 * | 0 | "Poor yield (<2%)" | 10 |
 * | **10** (778 rows, 78.3%) | "Below average yield (2-3%)" | 30 |
 * | 30 | "Average yield (3-4%)" | 50 |
 * | 50 | "Good yield (4-5%)" | 70 |
 * | 65 | "Excellent yield (5-6%)" | 85 |
 *
 * So a document says *"Good yield (4-5%) — Adequate cash flow"* beside a score
 * of 50 that the reader has no way to reconcile with it.
 *
 * The penalty also discriminates nothing. It landed on essentially the whole
 * corpus, because an Australian residential property at current prices is
 * almost always negatively geared before tax. A term that applies to ~99% of
 * cases carries no information — it just shifts the entire dimension down 20
 * points and compresses an already-narrow scale.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * **Yield measures the property's rental return. Nothing else.** Whether the
 * buyer's financing makes the holding cash-flow negative is a fact about the
 * loan, the deposit and the tax position — not about the property — and it
 * belongs to the financial and risk assessment, which is where
 * {@link holdingCashFlowSignal} sends it. The same characteristic is never
 * charged twice.
 *
 * **Absent rent is absent.** No rent means no yield: null, never 0%, never the
 * bottom band. That is the rule the 0.00%-yield work established, and banding
 * an unknown rent as "Poor yield (<2%)" is the same defect wearing a label.
