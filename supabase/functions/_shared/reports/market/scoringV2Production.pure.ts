/**
 * ME-8 — Scoring V2 as the production grade engine.
 *
 * ## The decision this records
 *
 * On 15 September 2026 the platform owner instructed that the grading system
 * be rectified: every new report was reading "Grade withheld — no scoring
 * system is currently authorised to issue an overall grade", because
 * `PRODUCTION_SCORING_AUTHORITY` was `unavailable` (V1 is not trusted to
 * grade) and Scoring V2 was frozen but never wired. This module is the
 * activation: the frozen engine (`shadowScorer.pure.ts`) is the one that
 * scores a new property report, and its result is projected onto the record
 * every reader already understands.
 *
 * `SCORING_V2_ACTIVATION` is the record of that decision. It is a constant
 * rather than configuration because activating an engine is a decision with a
 * review behind it — the same reason `PRODUCTION_SCORING_AUTHORITY` was — and
 * an environment variable is not that decision.
 *
 * ## What activation does NOT change
 *
 * **Nothing about the methodology.** Weights, anchors, eligibility ceilings
 * and the missing-data contract are the frozen engine's, untouched and still
 * pinned by `scoringMethodology.spec.ts`. Activation wires the engine; it
 * does not tune it.
 *
 * **Nothing about what may count.** The forward-only input policy still rules
 * on Location: its three inputs are `requires_repair` and count only when
 * declared verified for the run. Since IPV 1.1.0 (16 Sep 2026) that
 * declaration is DERIVED by the scoring service from the enrichment's own
 * RF-7.2B acquisition stamp — subject-matched, stage-proven readings verify
 * (`locationInputVerification.pure.ts`); a stampless legacy enrichment
 * verifies nothing, and Location then stays null and disclosed exactly as
 * before, with regeneration (which re-acquires with a stamp) as the remedy.
 *
 * **Nothing stored.** No historical row is recomputed. A score issued under V1
 * keeps its stamp; a withholding keeps its stamp; the next run of a report is
 * the first to carry `authority: 'v2'`.
 *
 * ## Publication: three valid dimensions, proportionally weighted
 *
 * Two rules used to stand between a measured assessment and a published
 * grade, and S5/S6 §4 and §8 removed both.
 *
 * **Growth was required**, over and above the engine's floor. The reasoning
 * was sound on its own terms: without Growth's 40 points the DELIVERED-points
 * ceiling capped the letter at a B and typically a C, so the grade read as a
 * statement about missing data wearing the shape of a statement about the
 * property. But the premise was that ceiling, and the ceiling itself was the
 * defect — `gradeEligibility` 3.0.0 removed it, because it lowered a grade
 * solely because a dimension was unavailable, which contradicts proportional
 * scoring. With the ceiling gone the premise goes with it: a three-dimension
 * assessment is scored across the dimensions it HAS, and 70% of the matrix
 * assessed is a real finding rather than a 60-point cap.
 *
 * **The five-dimension completion gate** (18 September 2026) withheld the
 * letter until all five scored. That is the right answer to "is this
 * assessment complete" and the wrong answer to "may a client be told what we
 * measured". It is superseded by the same sections.
 *
 * What rules now is `scorePublicationPolicy.pure.ts`: five of five issues a
 * score and grade; four and three issue a QUALIFIED score and grade computed
 * proportionally over the valid dimensions' original weights; two or fewer
 * publish no score, no grade, no gauge and no score-derived verdict, and say
 * briefly why. A dimension counts only where it produced a finite 0–100
 * score — a genuine zero counts, a `scored: true` flag alone never does.
 *
 * Every remaining safeguard is about the EVIDENCE rather than the count: the
 * A/A+ growth-confidence and evidence-quality ceilings stand, because they
 * answer "can this evidence carry this claim", which is a different question
 * from "how many dimensions answered".
 *
 * ## Absence is named, never hidden
 *
 * A withheld grade used to say only "insufficient verified evidence". Here it
 * carries `gradeGaps`: one entry per unmeasured dimension, with the client
 * sentence (`NOT_ASSESSED_REASON`, no codebase vocabulary), the operator
 * detail (the provider's refusal, the missing postcode, the unrepaired
 * inputs) and the remedy. The Generated Reports card and the report page
 * render the same list, so an operator asking "why is there no grade" is
 * told what would change it.
 *
 * Pure: no HTTP, no clock beyond the injected `now`, Deno-parseable. The only
 * production entrypoint that may import it is `investment-scoring-service`,
 * asserted by the pin spec.
