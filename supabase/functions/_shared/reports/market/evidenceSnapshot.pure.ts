/**
 * ME-6 — the immutable evidence snapshot ME-7 backtests against.
 *
 * ## Why a snapshot rather than live calls
 *
 * ME-7 runs the trusted historical corpus, inspects the score distribution and
 * decides whether the methodology needs calibrating. That is only meaningful if
 * re-running it produces the same answer. A provider's suburb median moves
 * every quarter and its API can be re-priced, rate-limited or withdrawn — so a
 * backtest driven by live calls is a measurement whose instrument changes while
 * it is being read, and a "calibration" derived from it cannot be defended a
 * month later.
 *
 * The snapshot is therefore the unit of reproducibility: extract once, seal,
 * and let every subsequent run read the sealed bytes.
 *
 * ## Sealed means sealed
 *
 * A snapshot is `draft` while records are being added and `sealed` afterwards.
 * Sealing computes a content hash over the records in canonical order; any
 * later change to any record changes the hash, so a snapshot cannot be edited
 * and still claim to be the one a result was computed from. The database
 * enforces it too (a trigger refuses UPDATE and DELETE on a sealed snapshot) —
 * belt and braces, because this repo has twice found a rule that existed only
 * in application code and was bypassed by the one caller that mattered.
 *
 * ## What a snapshot must identify, and why each
 *
 * | field | why ME-7 cannot proceed without it |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | provider | two providers' medians are different series |
 * | extractedAt | when we asked |
 * | evidenceAsOf | the newest period the DATA describes — not the same thing |
 * | methodologyVersions | a score is only reproducible against the code that made it |
 * | geographyVersion | which trusted-geography resolution the subjects came from |
 * | licensingStatus | whether a figure may leave a shadow backtest at all |
 *
 * `extractedAt` and `evidenceAsOf` are separate on purpose. The sanctions work
 * settled it: freshness of the load is not currency of the data, and a
 * four-year-old file downloaded today passes every check that reads only the
 * download date.
 *
 * ## Licensing travels with the snapshot
 *
 * A snapshot whose records are `unverified` may be scored and may not be
 * rendered. That is a property of the evidence, not of the reader, so it is
 * recorded once at the header and per record, and {@link snapshotMayReachClientReport}
 * answers the question rather than each call site deciding.
