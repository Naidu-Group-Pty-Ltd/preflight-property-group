/**
 * ME-3 — the deterministic Capital Growth methodology.
 *
 * Reads {@link MarketEvidence} and nothing else. No provider names, no HTTP, no
 * model. Given the same evidence it returns the same score, and every component
 * of that score can be shown to a client beside the number it came from.
 *
 * ## What this exists to fix
 *
 * V1 pinned Growth at a placeholder 50 on 975 of 992 reports (§46). The ABS
 * backtest then showed that simply feeding it *regional* growth is not the
 * answer either: growth is 40% of the composite and every property in a state
 * receives the identical regional figure, so the within-state spread was 9-25
 * points against a 55-point between-state swing — the median Perth property
 * became an A+ and no Sydney property could reach A (§48).
 *
 * So a Growth score has to answer two questions, not one:
 *
 *   1. **How strongly has this suburb and dwelling type actually performed?**
 *   2. **How does that compare with the wider market it sits in?**
 *
 * The second is what stops "Perth is strong, therefore every Perth property is
 * exceptional", and equally what lets an outstanding Sydney suburb score highly
 * while NSW as a whole is flat.
 *
 * ## The five components
 *
 * | component | weight | why | overlap with `longTerm` |
 * | --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
 * | long-term (5yr CAGR) | 0.45 | the most authoritative single reading | — |
 * | trajectory (3yr vs 5yr) | 0.15 | has the recent period confirmed the long run? | r = 0.02 |
 * | momentum (1yr) | 0.10 | deliberately small — one strong year must not dominate | r = 0.81 |
 * | consistency | 0.15 | +20/−10/flat is not the same as steady compounding | r = 0.47 |
 * | relative to benchmark | 0.15 | the suburb's performance net of its market | r = 0.84 |
 *
 * Those correlations are measured, not asserted — 600 synthetic series varying
 * trend, volatility, shape and benchmark independently (ME-4-B). Two remain
 * high and are kept deliberately. **Momentum's 0.81 is partly an artefact of
 * the sweep**, whose last-year return is a deterministic function of the same
 * trend that drives the five-year rate; a real suburb's last year diverges far
 * more, and at 0.10 the weight bounds the damage either way. **Relative's 0.84
 * is inherent to what "relative" means** — with the benchmark held still,
 * out-performance is monotone in the subject's own growth, and it decorrelates
 * exactly when benchmarks move, which is the case audit §48 exists to protect.
 * Neither is a second award for the same fact; both are stated rather than
 * quietly carried.
 *
 * Weights are renormalised across the components that could actually be
 * computed. That is arithmetic, not judgement, and it is precisely why
 * {@link scoreGrowth} returns a **confidence** alongside the score: thin
 * evidence renormalised to 100% is still thin evidence, and the eligibility
 * rule — not the score — is what refuses it an A+.
 *
 * ## Three rules
 *
 * **Missing is missing.** A component with no evidence is excluded, never
 * scored 0 and never scored 50. The one place 50 appears is
 * {@link scoreRelative} at a spread of exactly zero — and there it is a
 * *measurement*, meaning "performed precisely in line with its benchmark",
 * which is a real finding rather than an absent one.
 *
 * **A benchmark is context, never the score.** The relative component carries
 * 0.15. A property cannot ride its region to a high Growth score, because the
 * other 0.85 is the suburb's own measured performance.
 *
 * **Longer horizons outrank shorter ones.** 5yr and 3yr together carry 0.60
 * against momentum's 0.10, so a single exceptional twelve months moves the
 * score by a few points rather than transforming it.
