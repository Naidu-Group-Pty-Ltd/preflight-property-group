/**
 * ME-3 — the deterministic Market Demand methodology.
 *
 * Reads {@link MarketEvidence} and nothing else, on the same terms as
 * {@link scoreGrowth}: same evidence in, same score out, every component
 * showable to a client beside the measurement it came from.
 *
 * ## What this exists to fix
 *
 * Growth was a placeholder on 975 of 992 reports (§46). Demand is worse, and
 * the measurement is unambiguous. Across the 999 scored reports on 2026-09-08:
 *
 * ```
 * demandScore.score   = 50     on 999 of 999   (100.0%)
 * demandScore.hasData = false  on 999 of 999
 * demandScore.details = ""     on 999 of 999
 * ```
 *
 * Not "mostly a placeholder" — the base score of `50`, never once moved by any
 * evidence, on every report the platform has ever produced, holding 15% of the
 * composite weight and saying nothing at all about why.
 *
 * Every one of its four inputs fails, and each fails for its own reason:
 *
 * | input | the scorer reads | what the record holds | reports |
 * | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
 * | `vacancyRate` | `marketData.vacancyRate` | no `marketData` key exists | 0 of 1,201 |
 * | `daysOnMarket` | `marketData.daysOnMarket` | ditto | 0 of 1,201 |
 * | `medianSuburbPrice` | `marketData.medianPrice` | ditto | 0 of 1,201 |
 * | `unemploymentRate` | `demographics.unemploymentRate` | `demographics.income.unemploymentRate`, as a **string** | 865 unreachable |
 *
 * The last one is the instructive one, twice over. It is a container error —
 * the value is one level down from where the reader looks, so a real number is
 * invisible — and **849 of those 865 carry the identical value `"3.5"`**,
 * stamped `source: "ABS Census 2021 estimates"`. Repairing the path would have
 * moved Demand from one flat constant to another, and attributed it to the ABS
 * on the way. A dimension can be wired correctly and still be worthless.
 *
 * That is the argument for going through {@link MarketEvidence} rather than
 * repairing the reader: a constant cannot pass as a measurement here, because
 * every point has to name its provider, geography, period and sample size.
 *
 * ## Measuring one characteristic once
 *
 * Three inputs to the live property composite are scored in two of its
 * dimensions each, and the second site says so in its own words:
 *
 * | input | scored in | and again in | which calls it |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `vacancyRate` | `calculateDemandScore:835` | `calculateRiskScore:1016` | *"weak rental **demand**"* |
 * | `daysOnMarket` | `calculateDemandScore:861` | `calculateRiskScore:1036` | *"indicates weak **demand**"* |
 * | `populationGrowth` | — | `calculateGrowthScore:736` | *"population growth driving **demand**"* |
 *
 * Risk deducts up to 22 points for a vacancy rate Demand has already scored,
 * naming the characteristic as demand while doing it; and Growth adds 10
 * points for population growth on the stated grounds that it drives demand,
 * inside the dimension that measures capital growth.
 *
 * So this module states what it owns and what it refuses, and
 * {@link DEMAND_EXCLUSIONS} makes the refusal checkable rather than a promise
 * in a comment. Two boundaries are worth naming:
 *
 * **Demand is not Growth.** Price movement is Growth's, at every horizon. A
 * suburb where prices rose is not thereby in demand *as well* — that is the
 * same fact counted twice, and it is how a strong market comes to look
 * exceptional on two dimensions for one reason. Population growth is the
 * exception, and only because it is a **driver**: it says people are arriving,
 * not that values rose, which is the distinction `MarketEvidence` already
 * carries on the field itself.
 *
 * **Demand is not Yield.** Yield measures the rent LEVEL against the price.
 * Vacancy measures whether the property lets at all. A 6% yield in a suburb
 * with 7% vacancy is a different proposition from a 6% yield at 0.8%, and
 * collapsing them loses precisely that.
 *
 * ## The four components
 *
 * | component | weight | measures |
 * | --- | ---: | --- |
 * | rental tightness | 0.35 | can it be let, and how quickly |
 * | sale urgency | 0.35 | how hard buyers compete for stock |
 * | absorption | 0.15 | turnover against stock on the market |
 * | population driver | 0.15 | whether the resident base is growing |
 *
 * Sale urgency takes three readings — days on market, vendor discount, auction
 * clearance — and **blends them into one component rather than scoring three**.
 * They are three lenses on a single characteristic, and giving each its own
 * weight would charge for it three times in the same dimension the module
 * exists to stop charging twice across dimensions.
 *
 * As in Growth: weights renormalise over what was measured, a missing
 * component is excluded rather than scored 0 or 50, and the score is `null`
 * when nothing could be computed. The two places a 50 appears — 3.0% vacancy
 * and a 60% clearance rate — are *measurements* of a balanced market, which is
 * a real finding, and they are stated rather than avoided.
