/**
 * What a 10 Year Cash Flow Analysis says, as a shape.
 *
 * ## Why the browser sends the numbers
 *
 * The Borrowing Capacity Snapshot is computed server-side on purpose: "for a
 * document that tells someone how much they can borrow, the contents are not the
 * browser's to decide." That reasoning does not carry over here, and pretending
 * it does would ship a worse document.
 *
 * A borrowing capacity assessment is a saved row. A cash flow projection is not:
 * `CashFlowAnalysisModal` lets an adviser override any of ten fields in any of
 * ten years, live, and those overrides are not persisted until they press save.
 * A server that recomputed from `investment_reports.financial_calculations`
 * would produce a *different* ten years from the one the adviser just reviewed,
 * and the client would receive numbers nobody looked at.
 *
 * So the split is drawn one step further out. The browser owns the arithmetic —
 * it already does, in the amortisation engine the modal drives — and the server
 * owns the **document**: the brand, the company block, the disclaimer, the
 * typography, the page geometry, storage, signing and the audit row. Everything
 * the legacy jsPDF generator got wrong is on the server's side of that line.
 *
 * What the server does not do is trust. `normalise.pure.ts` rejects a payload
 * that is not a complete, finite, correctly-shaped projection, because a table
 * of `NaN` printed on company letterhead is worse than an error.
