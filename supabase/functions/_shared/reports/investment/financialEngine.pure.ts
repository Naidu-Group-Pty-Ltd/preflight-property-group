/**
 * The investment financial engine — every figure the calculator service
 * publishes, as pure arithmetic with no IO. `financial-calculator-service`
 * orchestrates (stamp duty schedule, live CPI cache, HTTP) and delegates all
 * calculation here; `generate-investment-report` derives its prompt-narrative
 * figures from the same helpers so the prose and the tables it introduces
 * cannot disagree.
 *
 * Why this module exists at all: the projections used to fold
 * `Object.values(annualCosts)` — an object that carries its own totals
 * (`totalAnnual`, `totalAnnualExcludingLandTax`) and a percentage beside the
 * line items — so every year of every stored 10-year series charged the
 * operating costs roughly three times over. Measured on a production row
 * ($1.19M property): stored year-1 operating expenses $59,931 against real
 * annual costs of $21,418, overstating the year-1 holding cost by ~$38k and
 * the 10-year cumulative position by ~$370k, while the headline metrics used
 * a different (un-inflated, land-tax-excluded) base — a $43,885/yr
 * contradiction printed on one page. The arithmetic lives once now, against
 * one cost base, and is pinned by `financialEngine.spec.ts` with that
 * production row.
 *
 * The one deliberate asymmetry: net rental YIELD excludes land tax (it is a
 * property-comparison metric and land tax depends on the owner's aggregated
 * landholdings, not the property), while every CASH FLOW figure includes it
 * (the money leaves the owner's account). Reports state the exclusion.

 * A finance block that breaks this describes two different deals. Measured

 * at one LVR beside a loan taken at another — on one, $134,400 and $604,800
 * against a $672,000 purchase, so the two lines a client reads exceed what
 * they are buying by $67,200. The written analysis then repeats the loan
 * block's LVR up to twelve times, because that is the number the model was
 * handed.
 *
 * The cause was the pre-rework override splat, which wrote some leaves of a
 * recomputed block and left others stale; `manage-investment-reports` now
 * recomputes through the engine (measured: 17 reports with an LVR override in
 * August and September, all consistent). What remains is the history, and it
 * is healed HERE rather than migrated — this runs on every read path the
 * register, the PDF, the comparison and both projections already use, so the
 * repair reaches every reader without overwriting a single stored byte.
 *
 * **`keyMetrics.lvr` is the arbiter**, because the engine derives it from the
 * inputs it was actually given (`(propertyValue − deposit) / propertyValue`).
 * Whichever of the deposit and the loan agrees with it is the surviving half;
 * the other is re-derived from the identity. Where NEITHER agrees, nothing is
 * healed — a repair that cannot say which figure is sound would just be a
 * third opinion, and `financeIdentityBreaches` discloses it instead.
 *
 * Verified against all 21 broken rows: 17 heal the loan, 1 heals the deposit,
 * 3 are left alone. Of the 13 that carry an independent witness — the
 * customer's own `manual_overrides.loanAmount` — **13 agree with the healed
