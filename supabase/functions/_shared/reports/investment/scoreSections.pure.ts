/**
 * Sections composed from the stored `investment_score` record.
 *
 * The score object is the one place the platform records how a verdict was
 * reached — grade, total, weighted dimension breakdown, and the four
 * strengths / weaknesses / opportunities / risks lists. Three surfaces used
 * to restate it by hand and each got something wrong:
 *
 *  - the verdict page's subtitle hardcoded "weighted across growth, location,
 *    yield, demand and risk", which misstates every variant score (the
 *    financial variant weighs cashflow and serviceability; the due-diligence
 *    variant weighs planning risk and liveability) — and printed
 *    "Graded  at  out of 100" with the holes left in whenever the record
 *    carried no score at all, which was every Strategic fork ever produced;
 *  - the Briefing asked a model to tabulate the breakdown from prose that
 *    never states it, and got N/A;
 *  - SWOT existed only as model improvisation, while the record's own four
 *    lists went unread.
 *
 * So the sentence and the sections are composed here, once, from the record —
 * and only when the record can actually say them. An absent score produces
 * no sentence and no section, never a sentence with holes.
