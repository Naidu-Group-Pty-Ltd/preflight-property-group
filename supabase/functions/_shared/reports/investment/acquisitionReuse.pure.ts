/**
 * Whether a persisted acquisition result may be reused on a continuation, one
 * dependency at a time.
 *
 * ## Why this is not "skip acquisition on continuation"
 *
 * A blanket gate is the wrong shape twice over. It would reuse a result
 * acquired for a different subject or under a different accepted input, and it
 * would freeze a *failed* acquisition as permanent — so a register that was
 * merely unreachable for four seconds would be reported as holding nothing
 * about the property, for the life of the report.
 *
 * So reuse is decided per dependency, and it is refused unless the stored
 * object can PROVE it describes this subject under these inputs. That is the
 * rule `locationEnrichmentReuse` already established for the enrichment
 * (RF-7.2B.1B1); this generalises it to the rest of the acquisition phase,
 * which today re-runs in full on every continuation because the early-persist
 * block guards the WRITE and nothing guards the FETCH.
 *
 * ## The four refusals
 *
 * 1. **No stamp** — a legacy object that cannot say what it describes is never
 *    reused. It re-acquires exactly as before, which is why adopting this
 *    cannot change any existing report.
 * 2. **Different subject** — address, postcode or state differ. A result about
 *    somewhere else is worse than no result.
 * 3. **Different accepted inputs** — the operator's submitted scenario changed,
 *    so anything derived from price, rent, LVR or loan terms is stale by
 *    definition. Geography-only dependencies are unaffected and say so.
 * 4. **Too old** — each class carries its own shelf life. A cadastral zoning
 *    answer is good for far longer than a market median.
 *
 * And one rule that is not a refusal: a dependency whose last attempt FAILED is
 * always re-attempted. Failure is a fact about that attempt, never about the
 * property.
