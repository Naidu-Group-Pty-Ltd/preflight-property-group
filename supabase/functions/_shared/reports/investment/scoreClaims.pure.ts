/**
 * A score a document may print is a score the record holds.
 *
 * The audit of 291 Stone Mason Drive (QA-18) found the Briefing announcing an
 * "overall investment fit … rated 68/100", a "Metro-linked accessibility score
 * of 82" and a "suburb fit score of 82 for commuter families" — none of which
 * exists in `investment_score` (financial score 39, grade D) or anywhere in
 * the parent document the Briefing condenses. The condense guide already
 * forbids restating the score; a guide is an instruction to a model, and this
 * is the check that the instruction was obeyed.
 *
 * Two rules. **A claim is recognised by its shape, never by its topic**:
 * `NN/100`, "score of NN", "rated NN", "scored NN" — the forms the corpus
 * uses — so a new name for an invented number ("fit score", "accessibility
 * score") cannot slip past a list of known score names. And **a claim is
 * supported by the record or by the parent, never by itself**: the recorded
 * set is the total and every dimension the engine actually scored; a claim
 * the parent document already made with the same number (a walk score the
 * generator measured, say) is the parent's to answer for and is kept.
 *
 * Suppression removes the SENTENCE carrying the claim — the unit of the
 * assertion — and reports what went, so the hygiene log can say "the model
 * invented a score" rather than the document silently reading differently
 * from the model's draft. A composed table is never edited here, because it
 * prints only recorded figures.
 *
 * A chart directive was left alone for the same reason — "a directive is drawn
 * from its own numbers" — and that reason was wrong for the two primitives a
 * MODEL writes as a verdict. Measured on 262 Pallas Street, 17 Sep 2026, whose
 * record issues no grade at all:
 *
 *   {{gauge: 85 | Land Appeal | Large block relative to typical suburban lots}}
 *   {{gauge: 82 | Large-block lifestyle appeal | …}}
 *   {{wheel: 25,45,30,40,35 | labels=Environmental,Crime,Planning & overlays,…}}
 *
 * Eight numbers, none of them in `investment_score`, three of them drawn as
 * dials — and a gauge on a denominator of 100 prints a verdict band beside the
 * figure, so "85 · STRONG" reaches a client as a measurement of their
 * property. The prompt asked for it: "Investment Score, Affordability, Risk,
 * Suitability, Confidence, and similar 0-100 ratings MUST use {{gauge}}". That
 * line is narrowed at the source and `suppressUnrecordedVerdictVisuals` is the
 * check that it was obeyed.
 *
 * It is deliberately NARROW. `gauge` and `wheel` are rating primitives and
 * nothing else; `pictograph`, `bars`, `donut`, `heatmap` and `tiles` carry
 * proportions and measured series, and dropping those on a number-match would
 * take real data off the page. A pictograph asserting a proportion nobody
 * measured is a residual, named rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Deno-compatible: no imports.
