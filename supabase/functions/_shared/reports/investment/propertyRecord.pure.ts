/**
 * What the record knows about the property itself.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to end
 *
 * `generate-investment-report` resolves every property fact by merging the
 * operator's `manual_overrides` over the listing's `propertyDetails` —
 * `effectiveLandSizeSqm`, `effectiveBuildSizeSqm`, `effectivePropertyType`,
 * `effectiveBeds`, `effectiveBaths`. Those merged values build the prompt, the
 * duty assessment and the score.
 *
 * Then it persists `property_specs` from `propertyDetails` **alone**:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const propertySpecs = {
 *   land_size_sqm: propertyDetails?.landSizeSqm || null,
 *   building_size_sqm: propertyDetails?.buildSizeSqm || null,
 *   …
 *   property_type: standardizedPropertyType || propertyDetails?.propertyType || 'Residential Property',
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * So the answer is computed, used, and then thrown away at the moment of
 * writing it down. Measured across the completed corpus on 2026-09-08:
 *
 * | the operator supplied | the spec column stored |
 * | --- | ---: |
 * | `landSizeSqm` | null on **127** |
 * | `buildSizeSqm` | null on **122** |
 * | `carSpaces` | null on **144** |
 * | `propertyType` | the literal `'Residential Property'` on **84** |
 *
 * Every one of the 68 reports generated since June 2026 carries an
 * **entirely null** spec block apart from that literal — including
 * `1/27D Mitchell Street`, whose address says unit and whose record says
 * nothing, and `6 Acer Court`, whose overrides hold 1,922 m², 253 m², two car
 * spaces and `house`.
 *
 * ## Two rules
 *
 * **The record must hold what the document asserts.** A fact an operator
 * supplied is persisted where readers look for it.
 *
 * **Absent is absent — never a placeholder.** `'Residential Property'` is not
 * a measurement; it is a hardcoded string that matches no branch in any
 * engine (`normalisePropertyType` returns undefined, `dRisk` tests
 * `unit|apartment|townhouse|house` and hits none, `financialEngine` tests
 * `=== 'unit'` for the strata estimate). Presenting it as the property's type
 * is the same class as a `0.00%` yield standing in for an unknown rent.
 *
 * ## Why reading heals as well as writing
 *
 * Fixing the write alone leaves all 1,180 stored reports with an empty spec
 * block for ever, and the facts are still there in `manual_overrides` on every
 * one of them. So the read resolves the spec column FIRST and falls back to
 * the overrides — the same asymmetry `healFinanceIdentity` settled on, and for
 * the same reason: a repair on the read path reaches every reader with no
 * migration and no stored byte overwritten.
 *
 * The precedence is deliberate. A persisted spec is what the generator
 * concluded at the time; an override is what a person typed. Where both
 * exist they agree (the persisted one is now built FROM the merge), and where
 * they disagree the historical row is the one missing the operator's later
 * correction — so the override is the better answer, not merely the fallback.
