/**
 * The section registry — one constitution for every investment-report tier.
 *
 * Law 3 of the tier framework (docs/reports/TIER_FRAMEWORK.md): *structure is
 * selected by section id, never by matching heading strings; a declared section
 * with no producer fails CI.* This module is the first half of that law. The
 * second half is `sectionRegistry.spec.ts`, which refuses to let a declaration
 * here be a wish.
 *
 * ## What it replaces
 *
 * Structure was defined in SIX places that competed, and no two agreed:
 *
 *   1. `generate-investment-report`'s `DEFAULT_REPORT_SECTIONS` — 12 generation
 *      groups naming 26 H2s, plus three more lists for the other scopes;
 *   2. `compassSectionRegistry.ts` — 12 `compass.*` + 11 `financial.*` ids;
 *   3. `reportSplitRegistry.ts` — FIN's 16 and PLDD's 17, routed by heading
 *      substring;
 *   4. `condense-investment-report`'s `TIER_CONFIG[*].sections`;
 *   5. the `structureGuide` prose inside the same object;
 *   6. a ninth heading list typed inline at the snapshot's trim call site.
 *
 * Number 4 was read by **nothing** — and the snapshot's copy of it was wrong,
 * declaring `Top Opportunities & Risks` and `Recommendation` where the guide
 * beside it asked for `Top 3 Opportunities`, `Top 3 Risks` and `Quick
 * Recommendation`, and omitting two more headings the guide asks for. Six
 * declared entries against nine real ones, in the same object literal.
 *
 * ## Why the sections are fine-grained, and tiers merge them
 *
 * The registry is the **union** of every section any tier draws, and a tier
 * that draws one heading where another draws four says so with `merged`. That
 * shape is forced by the corpus rather than chosen:
 *
 *  - The Due Diligence tier splits demand across four headings (socioeconomic,
 *    population, employment, tenant demand) and risk across two (environmental,
 *    and the dashboard). The Compass draws one `Demand Drivers` and one `Risk
 *    Dashboard`. A registry with only the coarse ids cannot emit PLDD's heading
 *    list; one with only the fine ids cannot emit the Compass's.
 *  - The Compass v3.0 cut folded six sections into two, and that fact lived in
 *    a code comment. Which is why the compass-40 engine shipped a report
 *    carrying the **unmerged** v2.0 sections — `Population & Housing Demand`,
 *    `Tenant & Buyer Profile`, `Employment & Economic Linkages`, `Education &
 *    Family Amenity`, `Retail, Healthcare & Lifestyle Amenity`, `Transport &
 *    Connectivity` — plus two sections the registry marks `includeInCompass:
 *    false`, and nothing noticed. Of five runs of that engine, three produced
 *    three different structures.
 *
 * Two more things a flat list could not express, both measured:
 *
 *  - **A tier renames a section.** One "purchase and holding costs" section is
 *    `Purchase & Ongoing Costs (Annual)` to the generator, `Purchase Costs &
 *    Annual Holding Cost Breakdown` to FIN, and `Purchase & Ongoing Costs` in
 *    the briefings production holds. The label belongs to the *placement*.
 *  - **A section is not always markdown.** The cover, the property identity
 *    table and the key-figures strip are drawn by the template from the binding
 *    projection. A definition that only knows `##` headings cannot say a tier
 *    has them, which is how "the spine is mandatory in every tier" stayed
 *    unenforceable.
 *
 * ## What a declaration is worth
 *
 * FIN declares 16 sections; two — `10-Year Cashflow, Equity & Growth
 * Projection` and `Financial Investment Scorecard` — had never appeared in any
 * of the 11 financial reports ever produced. PLDD declares 17; six consecutive
 * ones, `Planning, Zoning and Title Due Diligence` among them, appear on 1 of
 * 11, on the tier whose whole promise is due diligence. Nothing measured
 * either, because a list of strings cannot be asked whether anything makes them.
 * Hence `producer` on every placement, and a spec that resolves each one.
 *
 * ## What this module is NOT, yet
 *
 * Phase 2 makes the registry the thing the other definitions are *checked
 * against*; Phase 3 makes it the thing they are *assembled from*, and deletes
 * heading-string matching. So `aliases` is populated from measured production
 * headings and `sectionIdForHeading` works, but nothing routes on it yet —
 * `reportSplitRegistry` still owns the fork's substring routing and
 * `compassSectionRegistry` still owns the generator's prompt. Both are now
 * pinned to this file, so they can drift only by failing CI.
 *
 * Deno-parsed: no `@/` aliases, explicit `.ts` extensions. Bridged for the
 * browser at `src/lib/reports/investment/sectionRegistry.pure.ts`.

// ─── Tiers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The five tiers stored in `investment_reports.report_tier`.
 *
 * `strategic` is the stored value for what a reader is shown as the **Due
 * Diligence Report** — decision B of the framework. The rename is a label
 * change and lands in Phase 4 with the tier's own cover identity; the stored
 * value never changes, because rows carry it.
 *
 * Comparison is the framework's sixth tier and is deliberately absent: it is
 * not an `investment_reports` row at all — it lives in `property_comparisons`
 * with its own producer — and declaring a tier whose sections this module
 * cannot ground would be the fiction the registry exists to remove. Phase 5
 * brings it in with the storage it needs.
 *
 * One tier has two routes to it and this file describes one of them.
 * `report_tier = 'financial'` is reachable by forking a Compass (11 rows) and,
 * in principle, by condensing one — `condense-investment-report`'s TIER_CONFIG
 * carries a `financial` guide. That second route has produced **zero** rows, so
 * the financial placements below name the fork's routed and composed producers,
 * which is what the corpus actually holds. If the condense route is ever used,
 * its headings and these must be reconciled rather than allowed to be a seventh
 * competing definition.

 * kept, and also *reported*, so a new one showing up in production is visible
 * rather than silently swallowed.
 *
 * Text before the first recognised heading is the preamble — legacy documents
 * open with an H1 title block and often a `📞 CONTACT US` H2, and attributing
 * those to whichever section happens to follow would put marketing furniture
 * inside a client's verdict.
 *
 * **A section id may appear more than once, and repeats are kept in order.**

 * distinct sections, with `marketPosition` four times, `tenYear` three times,
 * and `loan`, `scorecard` and `environmentalRisk` twice each — the legacy
 * document spreads one section across several headings. Collapsing them here
 * would silently reorder a client's document and merge bodies that were written
 * apart; whether to fold them, and how, is a decision for the storage step that
 * consumes this, not for the reader that splits the text.
 *
