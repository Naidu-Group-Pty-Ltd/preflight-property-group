/**
 * The risk register: one compact table, then a readable block per risk.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The section was declared as `Risk | Level | Why It Matters | Required Check`
 * — four columns, one of them an explanation and another an instruction, over
 * roughly eight risks inside a 550-word cap. A grid is the wrong container for
 * two paragraphs, so what printed was a paragraph-heavy table: cells running to
 * four and five lines, a row taller than the page band allows, and a reader who
 * has to read across a column boundary to follow one thought. Every attempt to
 * make it fit made it smaller rather than shorter.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * A SUMMARY REGISTER a reader can scan — the risk, its exposure, and what
 * evidence stands behind it, each a phrase — and then a DETAIL BLOCK per
 * material risk carrying the four things a reader actually needs:
 *
 *   **Finding** — what was found, as a fact.
 *   **Evidence** — which register or record it came from, and when.
 *   **Implication** — what it means for this purchase.
 *   **Next check** — what the reader should obtain or verify.
 *
 * That is the legacy long-form report's educational strength restated as a
 * contract: *explain what important findings mean, why they matter, and what
 * the reader should verify*. It is the same shape `planningControlGuide` and
 * `infrastructureGuide` already use for a control and a project, so a reader
 * meets one pattern across the document rather than three.
 *
 * ## Four rules
 *
 * **Exposure and evidence are different questions and never one column.** A
 * level (`Low` / `Moderate` / `High` / `Not assessed`) describes the EXPOSURE;
 * an evidence reading (`Verified` / `Unverified` / `Conflicting` / `Not
 * searched`) describes the RETRIEVAL behind the row. Collapsing them is how a
 * completed search came to read as a clear result, and a test asserts the two
 * vocabularies share no value.
 *
 * **A register cell is a phrase, never a paragraph.** The explanation has a
 * place now, so a cell that carries one is a cell in the wrong container. The
 * cap is measured against the page band rather than chosen: at the register's
 * column width a cell of about twelve words sets on one line, and the rows a
 * reader could not scan were the ones that did not.
 *
 * **An absence is a level, never a position.** `Not assessed` is one of the
 * four exposures and belongs in the register; it may not be drawn, because a
 * chart has only positions to draw with. The one that reached a client put it
 * at the top of the measured risks' own scale under a legend that said so.
 *
 * **A detail block is offered for a material risk, never for every row.** A
 * register of eight risks with eight blocks under it is the paragraph-heavy
 * table again with more white space. `Not assessed` rows in particular carry
 * no finding to explain — saying so once in the register is the whole of what
 * can honestly be said.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no I/O.

/**
 * The shape, in the words the generator is given.
 *
 * **One declaration, and it was three.** This function had ZERO production
 * call sites: `compassSectionRegistry`'s `compass.riskDashboard` purpose
 * carried a verbatim copy of its output as a string literal, and the frontend
 * mirror carried a copy of that. So the words a model actually receives came
 * from the registry, this function was dead, and the two had already diverged
 * — the registry had grown four paragraphs about coverage and the evidence
 * chip that never reached here. Both registries compose this now.
 *
 * ## Why the register did not appear
 *
 * Measured over the three Compass reports regenerated on 20 Sep 2026
 * (9 Hollow Street, 1 Crestview Avenue, 97 Poole Road), read as delivered
 * PDFs: **one register in three documents, and that one did not render as a
 * table.** Page 23 of the Hollow document printed
 *
 * ```
 * Risk | Exposure level | Evidence chip | Due-diligence focus
 * •Crime | Not assessed | Unverified | State crime register and local police data
 * ```
 *
 * as body copy with a bullet — a header line and one row, neither of them
 * markup. Crestview and Poole wrote no register at all: three and four risk
 * sub-headings of prose, with no exposure level and no evidence reading
 * anywhere in the section. The QA validator saw none of it, because its only
 * register rule measures how long a CELL is and there were no cells.
 *
 * The instruction is the likely cause and the fix is the rule this repository
 * already pays for elsewhere: **a prohibition with no demonstration of the
 * permitted form is one a model routes around.** It asked for "a SUMMARY
 * REGISTER a reader can scan — Risk | Exposure | Evidence", which is a
 * description of columns written with pipes and no statement that the thing
 * is a markdown table — and the one document that tried reproduced exactly
 * that line. It now says the word "table", shows the pipes and the rule row,
 * and shows a detail block, because what a model is shown it can copy.
 *
 * `presentStoredMarkdown` carries the guarantee behind it
 * (`promotePipedPseudoTables`), because an instruction is a request and every
 * document already stored was written under the old one.
