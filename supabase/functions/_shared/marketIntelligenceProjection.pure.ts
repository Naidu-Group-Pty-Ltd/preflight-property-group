/**
 * What a Market Intelligence template may bind.
 *
 * ## This restates the report, it does not re-read the row
 *
 * `_shared/reports/marketIntelligence/` already builds a
 * `MarketIntelligenceReport` for `render-market-intelligence-pdf` — the eight
 * layers in order, the editorial strips applied, the events, the citations and
 * a notices ledger. This restates that, as every other projection in this
 * programme restates its normaliser.
 *
 * The strips matter: `cleanLayerContent` removes the model's "data limitations"
 * boilerplate, its empty regulatory sections and its duplicated brand tagline.
 * Re-reading `report_data` here would put all three back on a client's page.
 *
 * ## The layers stay Markdown
 *
 * Each layer is Markdown as the model wrote it. It is published as **source**
 * for `markdown-block`, which renders it through the programme's escape-first
 * renderer — the same arrangement Report Q&A uses, and for the same reason:
 * safety belongs to the renderer, so a projection that pre-rendered HTML would
 * move the escaping decision to its caller.
 *
 * ## Only layers with content are published
 *
 * The payload carries empty layers so a document can say it asked. Measured
 * across the six stored reports, **8 of 48 layer bodies are absent** — one
 * housing, two regulatory, one outlook, two suburb, two competitive edge.
 *
 * Publishing them in place would leave holes in the index a template binds by
 * (`layers.3` empty while `layers.4` has content), so a master would need a
 * conditional per layer *and* per position. Instead the empty ones are dropped
 * from `layers` and named in `layersOmitted`, so `layers.0…n` are all real and
 * the document still says what it asked for and did not get.
 *
 * ## Clipping is expected here, not exceptional
 *
 * This is the format that clips a section and says so on the page, and the
 * record shows why: `layer8_competitive_edge` runs 15,055 characters at the
 * median, and one stored `layer5_outlook` is **244,332** — about ninety-nine
 * pages of one section. Each layer therefore publishes the number of pages it
 * needs and, where a master's allocation is smaller, a whole sentence naming
 * what is not shown.
