/**
 * Opaque 5xx bodies, with the detail kept where it belongs: the logs.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * 329 catch blocks across 275 edge functions returned the caught error straight
 * to the caller — `error.message`, `String(err)`, in one case `err.stack`.
 *
 * A Postgres error message is not a sentence, it is schema. `null value in
 * column "password_hash" of relation "custom_users" violates not-null
 * constraint` names a table, a column and a constraint; `permission denied for
 * table client_income_sources` confirms a table exists and is guarded. Repeated
 * across a few hundred endpoints that is a free map of the database, readable by
 * anyone who can provoke a 500 — and provoking one is usually as easy as sending
 * a malformed body. The same applies to fetch failures naming internal hosts and
 * to stack traces naming file paths.
 *
 * The fix is not to swallow the error. It is to move it: the caller gets an
 * opaque body and a correlation id, the log gets everything, and support can
 * still join the two. An opaque error nobody can trace is a worse product than a
 * leaky one, so the correlation id is the whole point of this module.
 *
 * ## Use
 *
 * ```ts
 * } catch (error) {
 *   return new Response(
 *     JSON.stringify(internalError(error, 'send-email-reply')),
 *     { status: 500, headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } },
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * With sibling fields the caller relies on, spread it last so it wins:
 *
 * ```ts
 * return json({ success: false, ...internalError(error, 'bulk-generate') }, 500);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Not for 4xx
 *
 * `_shared/requestSecurity.ts`'s `securityJsonError` already covers deliberate
 * denials (400/401/403/413/429/503) and its status union has no 500 — that
 * omission is the reason this module exists rather than an extra arm on that
 * one. And a 4xx a user is meant to act on must stay legible: a password
 * strength failure, a validation message, "that file is too large". Those are
 * answers, not leaks. This module is only for the case where something broke and
 * the caller has no business knowing what.
