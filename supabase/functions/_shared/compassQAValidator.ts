/**
 * Compass QA Validator — Phase 7
 * -------------------------------
 * Runs structural QA on a generated report's markdown. Used by:
 *   • generate-investment-report (recorded on the report row)
 *   • condense-investment-report (returns assertions in response)
 *   • Deno tests (compassPostProcessor_test.ts)
 *   • Frontend QA panel (mirror in src/lib/reports/)
 *
 * ## A tier it does not know is a tier it must not judge
 *
 * It took two tier values and `condense-investment-report` called it with
 * `'compass-40'` for a Briefing and for a Snapshot — neither of which is a
 * Compass. Every condensation therefore logged and returned a report that
 * could not pass: a page band for a 40-page document over a 12-page tier,
 * eleven `financial-exclusion` errors on the financial chapters the
 * condensation DELIBERATELY attaches, and four to six
 * `missing-protected-section` errors naming Compass sections a condensed tier
 * never declares. Sixteen errors on a correct Briefing, every run. It blocks
 * nothing, which is what made it the familiar fault: a check that always
 * fails can never report a true one.
 *
 * The rules divide more cleanly than that call implied. Most of them are
 * about a REPORT rather than about a tier — no unresolved placeholder, no
 * score the record does not hold, no editorial label, no duplicate heading,
 * no promise of a table with no table — and every one of those is exactly
 * what you want asserted on a condensed document. Only three are tier-bound,
 * and two were already guarded.
 *
 * So the condensed tiers are admitted and the three tier-bound rules answer
 * to what each tier actually declares. **A tier with no declared page band
 * gets no page-band finding**: a Briefing's length is governed by the
 * registry trim and the post-processor's word caps, and inventing a band for
 * it would be a threshold nobody measured. **A tier with no section registry
 * runs no per-section check**, for the same reason — the condensed tiers
 * declare their headings in `sectionRegistry.pure.ts` and no word caps in
 * this shape.
 *
 * Checks:
 *   1. Page band: Compass 20–26, Financial 18–22, condensed tiers none
 *   2. Financial content exclusion from Compass (no yield/LVR/cashflow tables)
 *   2b. No unresolved placeholders
 *   2c. No editorial commentary label survives, in any form
 *   3. Suburb-narrative exclusion from Financial Analysis
 *   4. Duplicate H2 heading detection
 *   6. Protected sections present
 *   7. Per-section word-cap compliance
 *   8. Sub-heading density per section
 *
 * A finding is a report of fact, never a reason to discard a document. The
 * generator records this and stores the report either way: a report that exists
 * and is over its band is more useful to everyone than no report at all.

   * is a completion this report has no source for.
   *
   * Judged on the prose, not on the evidence: the evidence table is appended
   * AFTER this validator runs (so a word cap can never trim a row of
   * evidence), which means the only thing here to read is what the model
   * wrote. That is the right thing to read anyway — the claim is the model's.

   * as a relative term, and leaves alone a stop labelled by what a date IS

   * of which a register can support.

   *   "...multiple NEARBY ADDRESSES on the street recording no bushfire, flood
   *    or heritage overlays on public mapping at the time they were last
   *    updated.[Property.com.au, 119, 120, 137 and 139 Redfern Street
   *    profiles, 2024-2026]"
   *
   * which is the sentence `planningFacts.pure.ts` forbids by name. The
   * prohibition reached the model and NOTHING read the document to see whether
   * it was obeyed — the gap section 10.3 of
   * `PLANNING_CONTROLS_IN_THE_REPORT.md` named for a different rule and closed
   * with rule 12. And because the fork routes the parent's prose, one bad
   * sentence becomes three documents.
   *
   * ## Two findings, because they are two different mistakes
   *
   * The first version made any portal citation an error, and that was too
   * broad. **A listing is the authoritative source for the thing it IS** — the
   * asking price, the advertised configuration, the marketing copy — and
   * rejecting it wholesale would strip a report of properly recorded evidence
   * for an identity fact. What a listing can never do is clear the SUBJECT
   * PROPERTY of a hazard or a planning control.
   *
   * So:
   *
   *   `portal-sourced-hazard-clearance` (ERROR) — a hazard or planning
   *   absence asserted about this property on the authority of a listing
   *   portal or of NEIGHBOURING listings. Two nouns make it worse than a bad
   *   citation: it is a claim about a different parcel, presented as a
   *   clearance for this one.
   *
   *   `listing-portal-as-source` (WARNING) — any other portal citation.
   *   Disclosed so a reviewer can see what the prose rests on, not blocking,
   *   because the legitimate case is real.
   *
   * It REPORTS and never scrubs: prose is never regex-scrubbed, on read or on
   * write. And it is narrow on purpose — a false caveat teaches people to
   * dismiss the warning.
