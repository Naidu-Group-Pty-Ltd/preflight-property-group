/**
 * Lets a test import a `supabase/functions/_shared` module that uses a Deno
 * `npm:` specifier.
 *
 * Those modules are shared deliberately — the report client, the workflow
 * engine, the metering wrapper — and `src/` unit tests import them so that one
 * implementation is tested once. But Deno resolves `npm:@supabase/supabase-js@2.55.0`
 * from the registry and Vite has no idea what that is, so any test whose import
 * graph reaches one dies at collection with "Failed to resolve import" — a
 * failure about the *bundler*, in a file that has nothing wrong with it.
 *
 * That had taken out `reportDesign`'s conformance and provenance specs, which
 * reach `meteredFetch.ts` through `weasyprintClient.ts`. Nobody had seen it:
 * the `verify` job died at an earlier step, so the one that runs them had never
 * been reached.
 *
 * Stripping the prefix and the version pins resolution back at the node_modules
 * copy, which is the same package. Test-time only — nothing here reaches a
 * bundle or the Deno deploy, where the specifier is correct as written.
