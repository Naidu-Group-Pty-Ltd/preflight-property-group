/**
 * WHY THE BUILDER NETWORK MIRROR STOPPED MOVING. Read-only, this side only.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. The mirror holds 1,019 rows, every one of them `archived`,
 * none touched since 18 Sep 2026 01:31 — and the Builder Stock page therefore
 * draws nothing at all. That is a symptom with at least seven candidate
 * causes, and each of them reports as ordinary quiet operation: a flag that
 * is off answers 503 and the network's queue simply waits; a connection that
 * was never given a URL is RELEASED rather than dead; an unprocessed inbound
 * event looks exactly like an inbox nobody has written to.
 *
 * So this prints the chain in order, on THIS database, and names the first
 * link that is not doing its job. Its network-side counterpart is
 * `scripts/ops/network-sync-state.ts` on `aurixa-builders`; the two together
 * are the trace, because a stopped mirror can be caused on either side and
 * neither database can see the other.
 *
 * WRITES NOTHING, AND CANNOT. `sql()` refuses any statement that does not
 * begin with `select` or `with` — a property of this file rather than a
 * promise about how it is called, the same guard `builder-stock-mirror-state.mjs`
 * has. It does not call the apply function, does not touch the flag, and
 * does not deliver anything: the whole point of this pass is to establish the
 * broken step BEFORE anything changes, because a repair applied first
 * destroys the evidence that would have named it.
 *
 * NOTHING SENSITIVE IS PRINTED. An HMAC secret is reported as present or
 * absent and never echoed; a URL is reported as its origin and path.
 *
 *   node .github/scripts/builder-network-sync-state.mjs
 *
 * Needs SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN; PROJECT_REF defaults to this project.

 * Stock tab uses — also accepts `"true"` and `{ "enabled": true }`. A row
 * holding `{"enabled": true}` is therefore a flag an operator believes is on,
 * that draws the tab, and that the network door still refuses; measuring one
 * rule and labelling it the other is how a lane comes to disagree with the
