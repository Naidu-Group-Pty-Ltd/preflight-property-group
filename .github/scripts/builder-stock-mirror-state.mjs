/**
 * WHAT THIS MARKETPLACE WOULD DRAW, MEASURED AGAINST WHAT THE NETWORK DRAWS.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The collateral-column rule was written and proved on
 * `aurixa-builders`, where `scripts/ops/stock-item-state.ts` can measure the
 * live stock directly. This side has no such lane, and "the clone now behaves
 * the same" is a claim about a different database — so it is asked of that
 * database rather than inferred from the fact that the files match.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS MEASURING. This repository reads the `builder_network_stock_*`
 * mirror, whose seed copies EVERY image row with its whole `source_detail`.
 * Measured 19 Sep 2026: 1,019 items and 2,860 image rows — so an item here
 * routinely holds several pictures where the network's card holds one. The
 * exposure the rule closes is a card whose primary is refused for some other
 * reason ranking DOWN onto a collateral sibling. That is counted explicitly
 * below, because it is the number that says whether the port mattered.
 *
 * WRITES NOTHING, AND CANNOT. `sql()` refuses any statement that does not
 * begin with `select` or `with` — a property of this file rather than a
 * promise about how it is called, the same guard `stock-item-state.ts` has.
 *
 * THE RULE IS IMPORTED, NEVER RESTATED. The verdicts below come from
 * `columnDeclaration.pure.ts` — the module the product runs — so this cannot
 * measure one thing while the marketplace does another.
 *
 *   node .github/scripts/builder-stock-mirror-state.mjs
 *
 * Needs SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN; PROJECT_REF defaults to this project.

 * exists to avoid, and a parse that fails is a hard error rather than a
 * fallback, because a fallback vocabulary would measure the wrong rule
