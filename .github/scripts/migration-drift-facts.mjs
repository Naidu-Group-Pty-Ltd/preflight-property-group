 * declares one — whether its `@effect` probe is satisfied. No table contents,
 * no row values, only existence.

 * `apply-migration.yml` already makes between the route and the decision.

/*
 * Two routes, chosen the same way `apply-migration.yml` chooses one, and for
 * the same reason: `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is a session-pooler string Mission
 * Control distributes to a provisioned clone, and a repository that has only
 * a Management API token is not a repository without a database — it is one
 * reached a different way.
 *
 * Requiring the pooler string was this reporter's own first defect. Measured
 * 21 Sep 2026: the drift job failed at its credential check on the very
 * repository it was written for, four steps before it read anything, while
 * `apply-migration.yml` had applied seed v18 over the Management API nine
 * minutes earlier. A reporter that cannot run where the thing it reports on
 * happens is not a reporter — and it fails LOUDLY, so the gap was visible
 * rather than silent, which is the one thing it got right.
 *
 * Both routes are read-only here by construction: every statement below is a
 * SELECT, and a declared `@effect` probe reaches neither route unless
 * `probeIsReadOnly` admits it.
