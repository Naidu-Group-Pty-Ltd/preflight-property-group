/**
 * POINT THIS SIDE'S CONNECTION AT THE BUILDER WHOSE STOCK IT IS TO CARRY.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG, measured 19 Sep 2026 by the two halves of the sync trace.
 * The transport is entirely healthy: 91 of 91 events delivered on the first
 * attempt, nothing pending, nothing dead, the network's three producer
 * triggers enabled, its composer current, the HMAC secret present and this
 * project's inbound URL correct. And this marketplace still draws no cards,
 * because the single connection serves organisation `00f9e45f` — Bob The
 * Builder, whose 205 items are all archived — while the 46 live properties
 * belong to `dfdbff19`, Mairandi Developers, created on the network at
 * 2026-09-18 08:53:46 with its stock at 09:26.
 *
 * The network's `builder_network_enqueue_stock_item` reaches a connection
 * only through `i.organisation_id = c.builder_organisation_id`, so nothing
 * has been composed for those 46 since they were created. Nothing failed;
 * an event that is never composed is indistinguishable from a builder who
 * changed nothing, which is why it ran a day with nothing reporting it.
 *
 * WHY THIS SIDE GOES FIRST, AND IT IS NOT A PREFERENCE.
 * `builder_network_apply_inbound_events` refuses a payload whose
 * organisation_id is not this connection's, as `organisation_mismatch` at
 * severity critical — and a refusal CONSUMES the event, stamping
 * `processed_at`, so it is never retried. If the network were re-pointed
 * first, its whole 47-event backfill would arrive at a clone that still
 * disagreed and be burnt. The network's own half of this repair refuses to
 * run until this side already names the target.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES: one column of one row, guarded by the value it replaces.
 * No secret moves, no event is touched, no mirrored stock row is written or
 * deleted. `statement()` accepts exactly one shape of UPDATE against exactly
 * this table, which is a property of this file rather than a promise about
 * how it is called. Reversible by its own inverse.
 *
 * Nothing archives as a result: the network's reconcile archives only rows of
 * the TARGET organisation that it did not list, and this mirror holds none of
 * that organisation's rows yet. The 1,019 already-archived rows belong to two
 * other builders and are not reachable by it.
 *
 * DRY RUN unless APPLY=true. Idempotent.
 *
